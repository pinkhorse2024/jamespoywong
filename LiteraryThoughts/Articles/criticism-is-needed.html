                <h2><b>批评是需要的</b></h2>

                <p>本月九日伍君在 「时趣」写了一篇 “我也参加说几句”。 最末一段的结论是这样：
                    “海外集的每篇创作虽不能拿来与国内底文学作品相比拟，但是他忠实地描写我们底生活，说我们大众欲说的话。 单这一点已值得我们栽培扶植了。 一般的批评不会有什么帮助。 我认为至少在目前还非需要。”</p>

                <p>第一，先来讨论一下批评是否需要。 批评是一种工具, 批评家不必一定居于较高的地位, 批评的目的是学习和传布，却不是纠正。 批评家还是贤弟子，决不是严师。
                    愈之说：“中国人本来缺少批评的精神，所以那种批评文学在我国竟完全没有了。
                    我国文学思想很少进步, 多半是这个缘故。” 无疑的，文学的批评和批评文学是需要的。 在量上我们让它得到最自由的发展，但是在质上我们要作严刻的要求。 这当然是需要批评的帮助。
                    我们从来不梦想中国人会出些第一次提笔就写出举世杰作的人来。
                    无论那一个大作家都有他学习的时期。 鲁迅说，“一劳永逸的话，有是有的，而一劳永逸的事却极少。 就文字而论，中国的方块字便决非 “一劳永逸” 的符号。 况且白地也决不能永久的保留。
                    即有空地，便会生长荆棘或雀麦。
                    最要紧的是有人来处理，或者培植，或者删除。使翻译界免于芜杂，这就是批评。” 这些话同时可以用在创作文艺的身上。</p>

                <p>第二，伍君说要栽培扶植，可是没有批评又怎样培植呢？ 而且这海外集上的作品也不只是忠实地描写我们底生活，说我们大众欲说的话的。 它有思想的介绍，有感情的灌溉，有光明的显示，有希望的引导。
                    所以对于这些与我们日常生活有点隔膜而又必需的，当然更需要批评的介绍和指出。</p>

                <p>第三，这文坛的作品虽然还很幼稚，但是前程却无限大。 只要大家共同努力合作，未尝不能比拟祖国的作品，也未尝不能在世界的文坛上占一个位置。 说来像有点空虚，但努力总该努力。 伍君却以祖国的文坛而自卑起来。
                    但是到底祖国的文坛现在怎样，我们都不知道，何以就存心退缩呢？ 如果伍君满足目前的现象，批评当然是不需要的。 但是我却不满足，我知道我们还能够有更伟大的创作。</p>

                <p>没有批评来做向导，那便是像船没了舵，恐怕进行很困难的。 所以研究新文学的人，对于文学批评，应该有相当的注意。 伍君说我的批评失败，我当尽力自行检讨。 我是很欢迎批评的批评的，我也虚心学习。 伍君对
                    “恭喜发财”
                    解释的理论还不算是错误，但是他主张批评不需要的口号确是要不得的。 换句话说，批评是需要的。</p>

                <h2><b>Criticism Is Needed</b></h2>

                <p>On the 9th of this month, Brother Wu wrote an article in <em>Contemporary Interest</em> "I Will Also
                    Join
                    in and Say a Few
                    Words." The conclusion of the last paragraph is like this: "Although every piece of creative writing
                    in overseas publication cannot be compared with domestic
                    literary works, it
                    faithfully describes our lives and says what the public wants to say. Just this alone is worthy of
                    our cultivation and
                    support. The general criticism will not be helpful. At least I don’t think it is currently needed.”
                </p>

                <p>First, let’s discuss whether there is a need for criticism. Criticism is a tool, and critics do not
                    have to be in a
                    higher position. The purpose of criticism is learning and proliferation, but not to correct. A
                    critic is still a wise
                    disciple, not a strict master. Yu Zhi said: "Chinese people originally lacked the spirit of
                    criticism, so that kind of
                    literary criticism is actually completely absent in our country. There is little progress in
                    literary thought in our
                    country, mostly for this reason.” Undoubtedly, criticism of literature and critical commentary
                    literature<sup>2</sup> are needed. In
                    terms of quantity, we could allow it to freely develop, but in terms of quality, we must make
                    rigorous requirements.
                    This would naturally require the help of criticism. We never dream of the emergence of some people
                    among the Chinese who
                    write for the first time and could produce world-class masterpieces. No matter which great writers,
                    they all have a
                    period of learning. Lu Xun said, "There are some things that can be done once and for all, but there
                    are very few things
                    that can be done
                    once and for all. As far as writing is concerned, the Chinese square characters are by no means a
                    symbol of 'once and
                    for all'. Moreover, the uncultivated land can never be retained forever. Being that there is an open
                    space, then thorns
                    or brome grasses will grow. The most crucial thing is to have someone deal with it - to cultivate it
                    or disroot it. This
                    will allow the world of translation to avoid dealing with mixed and disorderly works. This is what
                    criticism is.” These
                    words can also be applied to the production of literature and art.</p>

                <p>Second, Brother Wu said that we should cultivate and nurture, but how can we cultivate without
                    criticism? Moreover, the
                    works in this overseas volume do not just faithfully describe our lives and say what we, the public,
                    want to say. It
                    contains the introduction of ideas, nurturing of emotions, revelation of illumination, and
                    guidance of hope.
                    Therefore, for things that are somewhat detached from our daily lives but are necessary, critical
                    introduction and
                    illustration are needed.</p>

                <p>Third, although the works in this literary field are still very immature, they have an immense
                    future. As long as
                    everyone works together and cooperates, it may not be impossible to compare with the works of the
                    motherland, and it may
                    not be impossible to hold a position in the literary field of the world. It sounds a bit
                    insubstantial, but one should
                    still work hard, yet Brother Wu felt inferior due to comparison with the literary field of his
                    motherland. But we don’t
                    even know what the literary field of our motherland is truly like now, so why should we deliberately
                    back down? If
                    Brother Wu is satisfied with the current phenomenon, criticism is certainly unnecessary. But I am
                    not satisfied, and I
                    know that we can still produce greater creations.</p>

                <p>Without criticism as a guide, it will be like a ship without a rudder, and advancement may be very
                    difficult. Therefore,
                    those who study new literature should pay considerable attention to literary criticism. Brother Wu
                    said that my
                    criticism lacked success, and I should try my best to self assess and reflect. I very much welcome
                    criticism of
                    criticism, and I am also humbly open to learning. Brother Wu's theory of "Gong Xi Fa Cai" is not
                    considered flawed, but
                    his slogan advocating for the unnecessity of criticism is indeed unacceptable. In other words,
                    criticism is needed.</p>

            criticism of
            literature) and <em>piping wenxue</em>
            批评文学 (literally, literature of criticism literature) could arguably be referencing the same notion of
            literary
            criticism, which has become more standardized to be <em>wenxue pinglun</em> 文学评论 in contemporary
            scholarship.
            These

            not standardized in Republican China (1911- 1949).</p><br>
