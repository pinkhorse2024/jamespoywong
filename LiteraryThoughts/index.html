    <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 28px;"><b>Literary Thoughts </b></p>
    <p>This genre of Wong's writings is relatively the least productive in quality and may be
      strictly disqualified as literary criticism when evaluated by academic standards. This is especially the case for
      the pieces published in
      the 1940s. With application of such rigorous criterion, these writings would be categorized more generally under
      “literary
      thoughts” on this page, despite the writer himself having specifically identified these essays as “literary
      criticism”.</p>

    <p>However, from the viewpoint of understanding the historical development of overseas Chinese literature, or to a
      lesser
      extent, the significance of Chinatown literary production and culture, Wong’s essays on literary thoughts in their
      unprofessional form
      and
      content are straitened windows to the world of a diasporic intelligentsia whose members from various,
      disadvantageous
      backgrounds had earnestly sought to build a literary circle outside of China. A memorable case in point is this
      <a href="https://jamespoywong.com/LiteraryThoughts/Articles/a-critique-of-christmas-gift.html"> piece</a>
      in
      which Wong disguised as another writer with a different psuedonymn and wrote a literary critique of his own work
      to
      invite or encourage further discussion within the confined literary community. The writer recalled that such a
      tactic
      was mutually used with his friends for their own writings as well to achieve the same eager attempt of creating
      waves within a
      placid
      literary pond within the ethnic enclave.
    </p>

    <p>Value of historical significance within this dimension could also be extended but not limited to tracing sources
      of
      influence that some overseas Chinese writers had from literature within China and beyond. Similarly, unique
      perspectives
      of such effort to build a literary movement among overseas Chinese could also be found in the pieces written in
      early
      ‘70s, prior to the proliferation of another movement recognized through the literary works by students from Hong
      Kong
      and Taiwan, the Foreign Student Literature (<em>liuxuesheng wenxue </em> 留学生文学).</p>
