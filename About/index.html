						<h1>About this Project</h1>
						</p>

						<p>While the writer himself admitted to having forgotten what he wrote more than 70 years ago,
							while we continued
							struggling with shedding off discouraging sentiments shaped by fear of utter indifference
							toward minority literature,
							diaspora study, and personal accounts of life recorded as reflection of intellectual,
							cultural and social history, while
							we contemplate in uncertainty the role of AI in the interpretation
							and production of literary
							and artistic works at large, the decision of republishing Wong’s writings was finalized upon
							an effort to preserve a
							certain collective past expressed in some literary works that had never been acknowledged,
							formally documented, nor much
							read beyond an ethnic community enclosed by social discrimination and nationally implemented
							policy of racism. The very
							decision was also made with the knowledge that such a project could only be pursued through
							personal connection with the
							writer, provided the nature of anonymity of the author published under many pseudonyms. The
							decision was further found within an
							embrace of laments toward and defiance against unending content being produced on the world
							wide web that are filled
							with increasing vacuity while becoming fully chaotic in the crisis of meaning of our times.
						</p>

						<p>Wong and I began this project in 2019 with a lengthy process of organizing and selecting his
							writings to be translated.
							With the intention to keep more of the writer’s original voice, I suggested Wong to
							translate his own writings. Upon
							completion of a few pieces, Wong requested for my assistance to polish his translation. As a
							result and for the interest
							of yielding a more presentable rendition, I took over the task of translation of all the
							writings when the initial
							editing of Wong’s drafts was proven to be less productive.</p>

						<p>Although Wong had kept nearly all original copies of his writings taped onto a leather-bound
							notebook, the publication
							dates of some pieces were found missing. During this organization process, we went to UC
							Berkeley twice in the summer of
							2019 to verify publication records. Unfortunately, a few volumes of <em>The Chinese
								Times</em> are
							missing in the archive
							collection of Berkeley’s Ethnic Studies Library, and some pieces remain with unverified
							publication dates.</p>

						<p>As I translated the original writings in Chinese, I consulted Wong numerous times about terms
							and expressions unique to
							his generation and local dialects in order to render more precise translation and
							transliteration. As each piece of
							translation went through minimally three drafts throughout the 18 months from the
							beginning of 2019 to mid of
							2020, Wong and I have countless discussions on his writings. All of these drafts and
							discussions still remain in our
							Google Drives. Nevertheless, it is important to note that any errors and flaws in
							the crafts of all current
							translations are entirely mine.</p>

						<p>Seeking for further understanding, I also requested Wong to write a “Foreword” for this
							project, in addition to a piece
							reflecting on the first few years of his life upon returning to America from China. In
							response, Wong wrote the
							following “Foreword” and “Jobs after School”, which is collected on the
							<a href="https://jamespoywong.com/Misc/"> Miscellaneous</a> page of this website.
							Both pieces are meant to
							give readers additional background information about this project as well as the young
							writer’s life before he embarked upon an endeavor of
							committed years in writing for the overseas Chinese community of
							San Francisco Chinatown.

						<h1>An Informal and Informative "Foreword"</h1>
						</p>

						<p>The 1940’s was a transitional period from old to new in San Francisco Chinatown. During this
							decade the great turn of
							events in the world affected the changes in Chinatown. In 1937 our motherland arduously
							struggled against the Japanese
							invasion, and in 1941 the United States entered into the world war. The war ended in the
							middle of the decade, and many
							established systems were destroyed. The overseas Chinese who were stranded in America could
							now resume their back-and-forth journeys to their homeland. However, the civil war soon
							erupted in China, and at the
							end the overseas Chinese were
							unable to adjust to the new Communist regime, so they suffered again the separation from
							their homeland. There were two
							new waves of people coming into Chinatown during this decade - first the youth and later the
							women. They were the new
							blood which became new forces in promoting the transformation of Chinatown.</p>

						<p>The youth of the ‘40s belonged to a special generation. The older generations came to
							America as laborers and returned
							home when they saved enough money. Upon his return he would invariably find a wife for his
							son, build a new house, buy
							half an acre of farmland, and when all his money was spent he would return to America with
							his now grown son and
							continue their hard laboring. And so this cycle repeats generation after generation. But the
							youth of the 40’s decade
							had more education than their fathers’ generation – some had high school training – so their
							outlook in life was broader
							than the old one.</p>

						<p>There were among this group of youth native, American-born children who went to the
							motherland to study. Although the
							older generations lacked training in education and culture, they were very concerned about
							the youngsters’ identities
							with the motherland and its culture. They established six Chinese schools in the tiny
							Chinatown for all youngsters to
							learn Chinese. But the children after attending English school during the day and Chinese
							school in the evening found it
							difficult to focus on Chinese learning, so the result was not satisfactory. But Chinese
							learning was important at the
							time, because there were few job opportunities outside of Chinatown due to discrimination in
							American society. Even if
							one could work in low paying jobs, running a Chop Suey restaurant or a laundromat, they
							still have to socialize in
							Chinatown and must be able to speak Cantonese. Therefore, to overcome this difficulty before
							a child became of age, he
							would be taken by his family or sent to China to study for a few years and returned to
							Chinatown to work.</p>

						<p>As the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression continued deteriorating and the Japanese
							army was approaching the
							homeland Guangdong, by the
							beginning of the 1940s, a large group of youth either grew up in the motherland or
							native-born
							in America who was sent
							to China, arrived in Chinatown. Having higher education than their parents and being tested
							by the war, they have
							individual ambition as well as social responsibility. Although far away from their
							motherland, they had not forgotten
							the task of national salvation. Being socially conscious and idealistic, it didn’t take long
							for them to realize
							Chinatown was a ghetto subjected to discrimination from the outside, and the attitude of the
							older generation who stood
							still and refused progress. Such realization encouraged their criticism of the ills of
							society and took up the
							responsibility of [individual] enlightenment. They formed musical clubs for maintaining
							Chinese culture and remembering
							their homeland. The drama clubs they established encouraged national salvation and imparted
							new knowledge to the people
							of Chinatown. On the individual level they strengthen themselves with knowledge and skills,
							preparing either to serve
							their motherland or to break out of the backward and confined Chinatown to advance into the
							greater American society.</p>

						<p>Chinatown was a small, closed society. Those who were born here and never sent to China for
							education and those who did
							were able to maintain normal social interaction without mutual alienation because they were
							classmates either in English-language
							schools or in Chinese-language schools. Although the first group has limited Chinese
							language skill,
							they, being in Chinatown,
							have nevertheless gone to Chinese schools and were influenced by Chinese culture. Most of
							them, of course, would not
							participate in the activities of those who returned from China.</p>

						<p>After America entered the war in 1941, those in this youth-group that was in the right age to
							be drafted,
							including non-citizens, and
							with few exceptions were not enthusiastic to become war heroes. The war subsequently
							brought some benefits to
							Chinatown. Many establishments [outside of Chinatown] began to hire Chinese because of
							shortage of labor due
							to the war, especially in
							well known restaurants, and the shipyards welcomed all who wanted to be trained to work. Old
							ladies sweeping the floor in
							the yard never thought of getting such high pay. Just before the war Japanese antique shops
							were pushing into the border
							of Chinatown, and they had to sell the shops cheap to the Chinese when they were being sent
							to concentration camps.
							After the war the returned veterans received subsidies to attend college, and among them
							non-citizens had the privilege
							to become citizens. Many of them went to China to get a wife, as Chinatown had an acute
							imbalance of male and female
							[ratio], making finding a wife a bitter part of a man’s life. Now the father’s generation
							could return home and bring
							back their long separated wives. These wives together with the GI brides formed a large
							surging wave of women who
							changed the bachelor society. Family number greatly grew in Chinatown. The family, now with
							husband and wife working
							together, enduring hardship and saving money, bought housing near Chinatown and began to
							move into the Richmond
							residential district. They provided higher education for their children, assuring their
							abilities to make their living
							in the greater American society. These newly formed families leaped from the ghetto to
							middle class, and their children
							almost completely westernized. The old belief of “fallen leaves returning to their roots”
							(<em>luoye guigen</em>) 落叶归根
							began to change into the
							concept of “fallen leaves fall to where new roots grow” (<em>luoye shenggen</em>) 落叶生根.
						</p>

						<p>The youth in the 40’s bitterly struggled in the conflict between old beliefs and new
							concepts, and they became the
							dedicators of this transactional period in Chinatown. While the previous generation
							following old tradition had no
							anxiety and the next generation being westernized was free to pursue their happiness, the
							in-between generation of the
							40’s had a rougher life than those before and after. We can say that they grew up drinking
							the milk of Chinese culture,
							their heart tied to the motherland cannot be severed and they didn’t want it cut. They could
							not forget those who raised
							them in a fatherless home, especially their mothers. They could not forget the charming
							lives in their youth in China,
							nor could they forget the suffering of their motherland and their helpless loved ones
							[living] under
							the iron boots of the
							invaders. So in America they participated in the task of raising money for the war effort,
							skimped and saved money to
							send home to support their mothers, brothers and sisters. On the personal level they have
							ambitions, striving to achieve
							higher education in preparation either to return home to serve the country or to develop in
							America. But in almost the
							whole decade of the 40’s, Chinatown was separated from China and they could not go back. The
							flow of mail was
							problematic and sending money home was almost impossible. It was a bitter experience not
							knowing whether the members of their
							family were dead or alive. Although there was a short period after the war ended that opened
							for travel, civil war broke
							out, a communist regime was established, and many struggling campaigns followed. Since the
							Nationalist government had a
							long history in Chinatown, the Chinese here once again could not return home to unite with
							their family.</p>

						<p>The youth of this transitional period concerned [about] their motherland, thought of their
							kin in hunger and sickness,
							but were unable to help and bore the pain silently. Living in a bachelor society they
							brooded over the lack of tender
							feelings from female companions. When they reunited with their old wives or brought back
							their new picture brides, there
							were unhappy marital problems because of the lack of adjusting time living together. The
							happy family embraced western
							culture for the benefit of their children, but the youth of this generation struggled in the
							uncertainty of national and
							cultural identity. Whether to follow the goals of the previous generation or to meet the
							needs of the following one?
							Whether to cherish the memory of the past in motherland or to forsake it
							to lessen the sadness of being pulled [by both sides]? Whether to take up hard work and
							schooling or just find an easy
							job and forget one’s ideal and succumb to immorality? Whether to return to the motherland as
							“the fallen leaves
							returning to their roots” or to stay here as “fallen leaves fall to where new roots grow”?
							They were bearing all kinds
							of pressure, being pulled in all directions, feeling the pain as a body being pulled apart
							by five horses. Their hearts
							were full of doubts, a sense of wondering and disappointment, and they could not clearly see
							their
							future. Silently
							holding their tears, they occasionally expressed a weak and depressed voice from the heart.
						</p>

						<p>I was a member of this group of youth. Our whole family went back to China when I was 8
							years old. I attended elementary
							school for three years and fled from the war for three to four years. Finally I sailed on a
							fishing boat from my
							parent’s homeland Taishan to Hong Kong and arrived back to San Francisco Chinatown at the
							beginning of 1941. I was then
							15 years old and had to start at elementary school again. The school was Washington Irving,
							located outside the border
							of Chinatown, and it served almost all over aged school kids from China. A year later I
							began to write in order to
							discharge my pent-up melancholy emotions. There were 5 daily and 1 weekly newspapers in
							Chinatown at the time. The daily
							papers were not interested in local creative writings with the exception of Mr. Gilbert Woo
							of <em>The Chinese Time</em>, so I
							submitted my writings to <em>The Chinese Time</em>. And when Mr. Woo went to <em>The
								Nationalist Daily</em>, I
							submitted writings [to] there too. Later,
							Mr. Herbert Lee of <em>
								The Chinese Time </em> designated a page for local writers; I continued
							submitting to that paper. In the
							late 40’s Mr. Woo published <em>The Pacific Weekly</em>, making it easier for me to
							submit writing
							there. In the first part of
							the decade the pen name I used most was Liu Lang 流浪 (Wandering), and in the latter period,
							[the
							pen
							names I used] were Hai Bai
							海白 and Bing Hui 炳輝. There were many [other] less frequently used pen names during
							this
							decade.</p>

						<p>All these writings were published in the newspapers while I was working and going to school
							at the same time, some 70
							years ago, and I have long forgotten what I had written. Recently a young classmate of mine,
							Honghong Ma, considers
							these writings to represent the voice of those special youths having high ideals and
							bitterly
							struggling in life in
							Chinatown during the period of transformation. She retyped and edited the whole work and
							polished my English
							translations. Actually she chopped with an ax and finely smoothened the text to make it more
							readable. Furthermore, she
							provided concise criticism of the writings. Her criticism is like a bright light
							illuminating
							my work for greater clarity
							as well as deeper meaning. She also views the 40’s from the current standpoint, making
							meaningful comparisons. Her
							worthy criticism can be appreciated independently. I sincerely thank her for her devoted
							effort and contributions.</p>

						<p>In bringing these writings out at this time, we have corrected the original indifferent
							punctuations, corrected a few
							unclear wording, but retained the original complex form of Chinese characters.</p>

						<h1>A Short Translated Autobiography</h1>
						</p>

						<p>James Poy Wong (1925-2020) was born in Chinatown of San Francisco, California. His ancestral
							hometown was in Taishan city, located in Guangdong, a coastal province of southeast China.
							In 1910, his father,
							Huang Wenkui 黄文槐, migrated to the United States as a merchant, who in 1923 brought his wife,
							Liu Xiuqin 劉秀琴 and their two
							sons for settlement in America. During this period, Liu and her sons were
							detained<sup>1</sup> for over
							two weeks at the
							<a href="https://www.aiisf.org/"> Angel Island Immigration Station</a> located in the San
							Francisco Bay on the West Coast of the United States. James ranked third in his family with
							four
							sons. In 1934, his entire family went back to China and did not return to America until
							1941.

								Civil Engineering. He
								graduated in 1949 and began various types of engineering designs and regulatory reviews
								of
								construction projects,
								including highways, piers, schools, hospitals, theaters, and residential housing. During
								this
								period, he went back to
								acquire a Master’s degree from his home school at U.C. Berkeley in 1956. In 1969, he
								obtained a
								Bachelor of Arts in
								English from San Francisco State University, and a Master’s degree in Chinese Literature
								in
								1972. James retired in 1989
								as a senior architect in the Structural Safety Department of Northern California.</p>

							<p>Wong's writing career began in 1943. The author submitted writings to several newspapers
								in
								Chinatown of San Francisco. He served as editor and translator for <i>The Nationalist
									Daily</i>
								from 1946-1948. After joining
								the organization of <i>The Pacific Weekly</i> with the introduction and support of Mr.
								Hu Jingnan 胡景南,
								between 1946 to 1949,
								the author published more than
								eighty pieces of essays, thirty short stories, ten [or so] poems, two plays, and
								fifteen
								pieces of literary criticism.
								Between 1972 to 1976, the author assisted Mr. Li Bohong 李柏宏 in the publication
