      <h2>
        <p>Acknowledgment</p>
      </h2>
      <p>For the completion of this website from scratch, I am grateful to a local software engineer, Brock Dilley.
        His professional guidance enabled me to design and complete constructing the site within four months.
        Please visit <a href="https://lennongrad.com/">Mr. Dilley's website</a> for his professional
        works. I also appreciate his suggestion to provide summaries for each piece of Wong's writings.</p>

      <p>Thank you as well to George Chen's suggestion of adding a note regarding the use of the Chinese hexagram
        symbols
        on the pages of Fiction, Poetry, Essay, Literary Thoughts, and Miscellaneous on this website. Adding these
        symbols is
        intended to promote general interest for the richness of traditional Chinese culture. These hexagram symbols
        originated in the classic text <em>I Ching/Yijing</em> 易经
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-change/"></a><em>(Book of Changes)</em> represent profound
        philosophical concepts that have continued being studied and
        practiced in contemporary Chinese communities around the world. Correspondingly, including these complex
        hexagrams
        on this website serves as a way to encourage close reading of the selected works to appreciate the literary
        prolificacy, aesthetic quality, and historical value of James Poy Wong's writings.
      </p>



      <h2>
        <p>Disclaimer</p>
      </h2>
      <p>Any errors and flaws on translation, romanization, and pending interpretation of Wong's writings are solely
        mine.</p>

      <p>Besides a few pictures of Wong that are taken from personal collection, other images included on the website
        contain proper source citation or are those personally created from Creative Commons images.</p>

      <p>Due to my lack of prior experience in web development, there are still a few minor, inconsistent
        features throughout the website, including failure in standardizing how Chinese fonts appear across different
        browsers and devices. For better visual presentation, Google Chrome and desktop view are recommended.</p>
