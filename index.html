                        This website is dedicated to collecting, translating, and interpreting selected, published and
                        unpublished writings by
                        James Poy Wong (1925-2020) 黄培正, an established, senior civil engineer in San Francisco,
                        California, who always had profound passion in creative writing since teenage years. Wong's
                        works were primarily published
                        in two periods: between
                        1943 to 1950 and 1973 to early 1980s. Having published in some two dozens pseudonyms,
                        Wong in reminiscence
                        regarded the pen name <em>Liu Lang</em> 流浪 (Wandering) to be the most meaningful one to himself,
                        which is
                        also argubly representative of the general experience of Chinese Americans in the 1940s.</p>

                    <p>As one reads through Wong’s writings - the short stories, poetry, essays, as well as works that
                        may be thematically
                        categorized under literary thoughts - one may find “wandering” as a thematic motif has naturally
                        manifested in multiple ways
                        beyond a literary trope. On various dimensions that have yet to be fully expounded in any
                        specific
                        ways within the literary scholarship of Asian American studies, the notion and imagery of
                        wandering as seen in Wong's writings could be deciphered as a
                        collective
                        memory
                        expressed through Wong’s personal sentiments toward a people living within ethnic confinement,
                        traversing through a landscape of social alienation, and struggling from a journey of diaspora
                        replete with conflicts among the cultural, national, and international borders. </p>

                    <p>In a short, informal autobiographical essay, Wong noted he had published around eighty
                        pieces of essays, thirty
                        pieces of short fiction, a dozen of poems, two dramas, and fifteen pieces of literary criticism
                        from
                        1943 to 1950. These
                        numbers have yet been finalized in counting, as Wong later realized he did not include nearly
                        two dozens of movie
                        reviews that he published in the ‘40s as well as other misplaced writings.

                    <p>In terms of publication sources, Wong’s writings in the 40s were predominantly published in the
                        following Chinese language
                        newspapers established in San Francisco Chinatown: <em>The Chinese Times </em>(金山时报), <em>The
                            Nationalist
                            Daily </em> (国民日报), and <em>The
                            Pacific Weekly </em> (太平洋周报). The writings written in the 70s were mostly published in
                        <em>The
                            San
                            Francisco Weekly</em> 旧金山周报, which was
                        co-founded by Wong himself and Li Bohong 李柏宏. In short, the formal record of all his
                        publications is not
                        complete, as some
                        publication dates could not be verified due to missing archives from the currently accessible
                        library. Read more about this record on the <a href="https://jamespoywong.com/About/"> About</a>
                        and the <a href="https://jamespoywong.com/Reference/"> Reference</a> pages of this website.

                        <h1>Notes on Romanization, Correction, Chinese Text, and Translation</h1>
                        </p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        For the interest of readability and consistency, Wong and I decided to romanize most Chinese
                        names in his writings in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin"></a><em>pinyin</em>,
                        with exception of a few names that remained
                        in
                        either unofficial Cantonese or Taishanese romanization to preserve cultural authenticity
                        of
                        the original writings. Similarly, for
                        names of people and places
                        that have historically been recognized in English-language scholarships, these were kept in
                        Wade-Giles.</p>

                    <p>Three types of errors have been generally found in the original publications, which had been
                        corrected by the writer
                        from 2019 to early 2020. The first category of such errors is typos and/or misprints. The
                        second type which occurs least
                        frequently includes misuses of Chinese characters. The last group of errors consists of
                        those that
                        were once broadly used by
                        the May-Fourth generation, typically represented by writers published between 1920s to 1940s
                        in the Republic of China (1911- 1949).
                        Some expressions had ceased being in use throughout the gradual reform of modern vernacular
                        Chinese by the mid-20th
                        century.</p>

                    <p>Given that the original writings were published in traditional Chinese characters which are
                        accessible through academic
                        archives as well as the PDF files that would eventually be uploaded to this site, I decide
                        to republish Wong’s
                        writings in simplified Chinese characters for the purpose of reaching
                        broader readership.</p>

                    <p>Most of the writings selected to be included on this website are my translations. Read more
                        about this process on the
                        <a href="https://jamespoywong.com/About/"> About</a> page on this website. Most of Wong's
                        writings
                        in the 1970s may also be added to this website without translations in the future.
