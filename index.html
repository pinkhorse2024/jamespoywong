                        This website is dedicated to collecting, translating, and interpreting selected, published and
                        unpublished writings by
                        James Poy Wong (1925-2020) 黄培正, an established, senior civil engineer in San Francisco,
                        California, who always had a
                        profound passion in creative writings since teenage years. Wong's works were primarily published
                        in two periods: from
                        1943 to 1950 and from 1973 to early 1980s. Having published in some two dozens of pseudonyms,
                        Wong in reminiscence
                        regarded the pen name Wandering <em>(liu lang )</em> 流浪 to be the most meaningful to himself,
                        which is
                        also argubly
                        representative of the general experience of Chinese Americans in the 1940s.

                        As one reads through Wong’s writings - the short stories, poetry, essays, as well as works that
                        may be thematically
                        categorized under literary thoughts - one may find “wandering” as a motif has naturally
                        manifested in multiple ways
                        beyond a literary trope. On various dimensions and yet never fully expounded in any specific
                        way, wandering could be
                        deciphered as a collective imagery symbolic of Wong’s personal sentiment expressed through a
                        landscape of social
                        alienation and experienced across the national and international journey of diaspora.

                    <p>In an informal, short autobiographical summary of his life Wong noted he had published around 80
                        pieces of essays, 30
                        pieces of short fiction, a dozen of poems, 2 dramas, and 15 pieces of literary criticism from
                        1943 to 1950. These
                        numbers have yet been finalized in counting, as Wong himself realized he did not include nearly
                        two dozens of movie
                        reviews that he wrote in the ‘40s.</p>

                    <p>Presenting these publications at a glance, the following chart records the estimated numbers of
                        writings published in
                        each genre during these periods. Wong’s writings in the 40s were primarily published in the
                        following Chinese language
                        newspapers established in San Francisco Chinatown: <em>The Chinese Times </em>(金山时报), <em>The
                            Nationalist
                            Daily </em> (国民日报), and <em>The
                            Pacific Weekly </em> (太平洋周报). The writings written in the 70s were mostly published in The
                        San
                        Francisco Weekly, which was
                        co-founded by Wong himself and Li Bohong 李柏宏. The formal record of all his publications is not
                        complete, as some
                        publication dates could not be verified due to missing archives from the currently accessible
                        library. Read more
                        information about this record on the About and the Reference pages of this website.</p>

                    <div id="Section3">

                        <h1>
                            <p>

                            <h1>Notes on Romanization, Correction, Chinese Text, and Translation</h1>
                            </p>
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            For the interest of readability and consistency, Wong and I decided to convert most Chinese
                            names in his writings to be
                            romanized in pinyin, with exception of a few names that remained in either unofficial
                            Cantonese or Taishanese
                            romanization to preserve the cultural authenticity of the original writings. Similarly, for
                            names of people and places
                            that are historically recognized in English scholarship, these were kept in Wade-Giles.</p>

                        <p>There are three types of errors generally found in the original publications, which had been
                            corrected by the writer
                            from 2019 to early 2020. The first category of such errors is typos and/or misprints. The
                            second type which occurs least
                            frequently is misuse of Chinese characters. The last group of errors consists of those that
                            were once broadly used by
                            the May-Fourth generation, typically represented by writers of the 1920s to 1940s of
                            Republic of China (1911- 1949).
                            Some expressions had ceased being in use throughout the gradual reform of modern vernacular
                            Chinese by the mid 20th
                            century.</p>

                        <p>Since the original writings were published in traditional Chinese characters which are
                            accessible through academic
                            archives as well as the images that would eventually be uploaded to this site, I made the
                            decision to republish Wong’s
                            writings in simplified Chinese characters, with the intention of providing both writing
                            scripts as a way of reaching
                            broader readership.</p>

                        <p>Most of the writings selected to be included on this website were translated by me. Read more
