Translation of 
"To Mother"ã€Œçµ¦æ¯è¦ªã€
"I shall then write down this address: 
Humanity, My Mother 
The Ruin of Hell, Earth 
Every Corner Dispersed with Humanity"

Dear Mother:
It has been a year. It has been a full year since I received your letter last May. I am afraid I havenâ€™t written to you for even longer time, perhaps a few years now. It wasnâ€™t that I have forgotten you; in reality I didnâ€™t have the courage to send out the letters. All the situations are especially dreary to me tonight. I often want to cry, and so I think of you again. My mother-- I reread all those letters I wrote but didnâ€™t send out. You seem to have appeared in front of my eyes and I drop to my desk and cry. Your voice seems to continue calling on me by my ears.
Mother, I really donâ€™t have much to say, but you most likely would like to know what has happened and changed in these years. No matter what, all these are things of the past and I hope you would understand.
Rest of the text goes below once fixed with these features: correct margin, scroll overflow, etc.
