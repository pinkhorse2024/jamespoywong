<h3>"To Mother"</h3>
<p>Dear Mother:</p>

<p>It has been a year.  It has been a full year since I received your letter last May.  I am afraid I haven’t written to you even longer, perhaps a few years now.  It wasn’t that I have forgotten you; in reality I didn’t have the courage to send out the letters. All the situations are especially dreary to me tonight. I often want to cry, and so I think of you again. My mother-- I reread all those letters I wrote but didn’t send out.  You seem to have appeared in front of my eyes and I drop to my desk and cry. Your voice seems to continue calling on me by my ears. </p>

<p>Mother, I really don’t have much to say, but you most likely would like to know what has happened and changed in these years. No matter what, all these are things of the past and I hope you would understand. </p>

<p>Come to think of it, it probably has been more than a year.   It was two or three years ago that my second brother and I were still working hard while going to school. You surely did not forget that we wrote letters to you every two weeks. From your letter in reply I could see you were smiling. I know you were happy in your heart,   although you felt pity for our impoverished living while feeling pleased and comforted by our studious spirit. You often said, “Don’t overwork. No matter what, we would mostly be able to live on over here.” In reality, you know we were not fooled by this kind of talk. I have long known the love of a mother for her children, but only until I left you had I learned its true meaning.</p>

<p>Yet the drifting of life did not cease upon arrival to America,  as a ship may sink too in the calm, tides-less ocean. Not long later, my Second Brother was drafted into the army.  I was afraid you would worry and I dared not tell you. We continued writing letters to you and speaking of our situation  better than it really was.   I started having feelings of loneliness after Second Brother had gone.  Though in the past I had separated from you , I still had my companion, now all I have left is hope-- hoping someday we will be able to unite again.  As to when I dare not imagine.</p>

<p>After Second Brother went to sea, I pondered for two days and finally decided to tell you everything concerning him.  I think many irreparable things in life are caused by the fear of facing them in the first place.  I wrote the letter and addressed the envelope, but I received your letter in the evening and all my courage was destroyed by this letter of yours.  You told me the news of the death of my Third Brother, the situation of his illness last September, and all of his sufferings and difficulties. Mother, why haven’t you told me sooner? Why didn’t you mention at all any of these dark, despicable things in your past letters?   Oh, you lied to me. And how can I throw at you now the bad news that I have kept for so long? How can I be so cruel to let it destroy my mother’s life?  Holding my tears I kept aside the letter, hoping someday this letter will be self-destroyed.</p>

<p>This was the evening I would never forget. The sky was pouring heavy rain.  When I returned to my residence after class, I received a telegram and learned that my Second Brother had died on the battlefield in Europe. He is dead, dead.  How can I not believe it?  He truly is dead and he is only nineteen years of age.  Who is it that gives him such fate?  I curse the war. I curse the nation. I curse this mankind. I have lost everything. My hope has finally perished. My brain was blowing up, and I let out a cry of a despaired person. In the thunderstorm I walked bareheaded into the silent, dark night.  The following day I was sick in bed.</p>

<p>When I could be up and about, my homeland had fallen into the enemy’s hands, and you had gone to an unknown place. What could I tell you?  The paths given to us by our times are different, yet in the end we share the same dejection, destruction, and death.  Someone put folded paper boats into the sea and hoped one would flow to his mother’s door steps.  But for me, hasn’t my own drifting in life enough, so why would I put another fate into drifting? My heart could not bear such and I can only let my broken heart be buried within my body.</P

<p>Mother, sometimes I wish you were dead.  This truly is not a word of cruelty.  I dearly love you more than I love anyone in the world, but I wish you were dead to ease your personal pain and free me from this long and boundless sorrow.  You do understand me.  I stand on this side of the ocean and I can’t extend a helping hand to you. You must understand my thoughts and feelings.
As human beings, we all want to live and enjoy happy events.  I tried to forget all those deaths of the past, so I visited other’s families and parents, hoping beyond expectation to share some of their joys with them.  But it was all hopeless and it made me more painful on the contrary.  When I saw others being happy,  I could only go back to my dark room, hold my head, and cry.  Mother, I am no longer a child-- why do I still have the emotion of one?</p>

<p>During the process of severe struggle against my own emotions, I completely lost my rationality and discarded the proper life path of a modern person.  I sank into depravation.  I depraved to a point beyond incorrigible. I don’t blame anyone, and I also don’t blame myself because none of these are someone’s fault but that of  a man-made system. Evidently what is most tragic is this:  people prior to obtaining awareness, they could only risk their lives in struggle, and when they failed they would completely destroy themselves.  Some people, such as me, have an opportunity to realize, but it is already too late because I have long had one foot trod into the grave and the other foot has just stepped on a banana peel. Merely in a flash, my life will be finished.</p>

<p>About eight months ago, I obtained a sum of illegitimate fortune. This unexpected money boosted my desire to seek happiness.  How could I have known that such desire did not bring me any bit of happiness,  and instead it would take away my life?  Days and nights I was messing up and fooling around, not going to school nor work, solely hoping to obtain other’s accumulated money. In a few months I have already lost my own nature. I virtually no longer know who I am.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I don’t wish to conceal from you. Regardless how comfortable my living was, my heart was nevertheless empty. I thought of every way to fill the loss of my motherly love. I pursued women, hoping that love can be transformed, but what I received was further unbearable distress.  Therefore I did the thing that you were most worried about. I went for prostitution, as if this is the only thing in this world that can remove the distress in my heart. But soon after I contracted the incurable venereal disease.  Now I certainly don’t want people to know about it.  I was afraid to see a doctor, but my illness worsened everyday until last month, when I finally lay in this hospital bed.  I am now a man no medicine can be saved.  The doctor was frank and generous. He gave me three months to live and I joyfully accepted this fate.  In reality there is simply no purpose in my existence now.   Life to me is not tragic, but I do feel death is best suited for me.
Now I have much leisure time for thinking.  It is a pity that I couldn’t dream. Once I fall asleep, I lose my consciousness as if I have died.  I really wish I could dream. Then, in illusion I can still see you.  Those who can dream in our times are truly blessed.<p>

<p>The news has gradually become better, and the war situation in Europe is ending soon. Many people are laughing heartily, but I am crying sadly.  Second Brother will never be able to come back. There are so many unjust things in this world: some with laughter and some with tears.  I know like me many people have their loved ones who would not return. I hear their sorrowful sobbing that no revelry and wild laughter can be covered up. But I wouldn’t be able to see more such scenes of tragedy in life.</p>

<p>I know I am not afraid at the time of dying.  Perhaps, this is a bit of human instinct.  Without doubt, I have nothing worth being loved and no object of love.  Apart from leaving this world that can only be completed with love, what else would there be to do?   I don’t wish to be in others’ way, and anybody can trot over my dead body. What is odd is that I have contemplated suicide many times, strolling numerously at the waterfront. Yet, in the end I still carried my heavy heart and returned home. Although I no longer feel the charms of life, ultimately, I am a little afraid of death.
 Oh, mother! I haven’t forgotten the time we lived together in my childhood, but those moments like mists and clouds had vanished. In front of my eyes now is a coffin,  but this memory is mine -- the only thing that I can take with me leaving this world.  I remember Tolstoy had said these few lines: “The days of being young and happy will never return!  How can I not treasure those lovely recollections?  The memory once again inspires my soul, and it also is the source of my most happiness.”</p>

<p>Mother, I have repeatedly told you that I blame neither others nor myself, because this is not people’s faults.  The people who led me astray also have human feelings and families. But they want to live, and this is society’s means of life available to them.   They can’t starve themselves to death for the sake of humanity. Starving oneself is killing oneself, and because he himself is a human being, doing so he would kill a human being -- and killing is most inhumane.  No doubt I know these straying paths must be eradicated, but before doing so, there must be plans for those many who depend on such paths for a living.  Given that the society is this way, they should not be the ones to be condemned. In such a social institution there must be many deaths whose sacrifices are for the existence of others -- this institution is not legitimate.  I don’t want people to follow my footsteps, but with the existence of these paths, someone would naturally be forced to take them.  How I only wish I was a bomb so I could destroy this social institution, but my fate is such that, after three months, without resistance I would be eaten away by tiny viruses.</p>

<p>The nurses outside the room are talking about Mother’s Day, planning on giving their mothers the happiest treats. So I crawl out of bed to write you this farewell letter.  Writing to this point, I feel what have been said are words of a confession. They seem somewhat inappropriate, but I don’t have the energy to rewrite them. What others give to their mothers is happiness, while I can only give you all that I have, and all that I have are sorrow and pain.  As I said before, many people build their happiness on others’ sorrow. Unfortunately, we are these unfortunate people.  If I write the kind of sayings that you like, I would be lying to you and I don’t want to do so.  Currently,  I feel the most important things in life are love and truth.  As to love I have no more, but I seem to still have some rights to truth.</p>

<p>Mother, I don’t know where you are.  You may have long passed away, but I would want this letter to be sent out. Mother is the one giving birth to me, thus this humanity is also my true mother.  Then, I shall write down this address:</p>

<p>Humanity, My Mother<br>The Ruin of Hell, Earth<br>Every Corner with Every Corner Dispersed with Humanity </p>

<p>Mother, if and when you have the chance of receiving this letter, I beg you not to cry.  Yet I have no way of preventing your sorrow. I remember someone wrote this line, “It is not known whether it is love that brings about sorrow or it is sorrow that brings out love.”</p>

<p>Mother, forever farewell.  Mother, allow me to deceive myself and others once more with this saying:  I wish you happiness!</p>
