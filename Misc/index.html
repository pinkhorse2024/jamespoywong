							Writings</b>
					</p>

					<p>Considering Wong’s primary backgrounds - educational, literary, academic, engineering,
						occupational - one would admire
						his commitment to writing the numerous works throughout his life despite excelling in a formal
						career as an engineer.
						Moreover, Wong was in reality deprived of continuous, formal education in the first sixteen
						years of his life, being
						driven in and out between segregated Chinese America and wartime China. Such disadvantages did
						not stop him from
						acquiring more university credentials in the decades subsequent to his completion of graduate
						school in engineering in
						1956. With four degrees - a Bachelor of Science and a Master’s in Civil Engineering, a Bachelor
						of Arts in English, and
						a Master’s in Chinese linguistics and literature - Wong had devoted significant investment in
						academic training as well,
						which yielded at least two theses that had been evaluated with publishable quality. (name both
						of these) Similarly, Wong
						had also published research studies in his expertise field of engineering. Only one of such
						publications is collected at
						this time of writing, and it will be included on this website as a pdf document for those
						interested.</p>

					<p>Other miscellaneous writings should also be mentioned. Between 1946 to 1948, Wong served as
						proofreading and translation
						staff for The Nationalist Daily. These positions may also have extended the focus of writing
						into a columnist for movie
						reviews. As a result, Wong also had written nearly two dozens of movie reviews for various
						newspapers in Chinatown.</p>

					<p>As of now, only a few works are collected on this page. The prologue of Wong’s novella, The Song
						of Immigrant Sons and
						Daughters may be translated and included on this page in the future.</p>
