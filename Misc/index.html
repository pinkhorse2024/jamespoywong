							Writings</b>
					</p>

					<p>Considering all of Wong's personal backgrounds - familial, educational, literary, academic,
						occupational - one would admire
						his commitment to writing the numerous works throughout his life while excelling in his formal
						career as an engineer.
						Moreover, Wong was in reality deprived of continuous, formal education in the first sixteen
						years of his life, being
						driven in and out between segregated Chinese America and wartime China. Such disadvantages did
						not stop him from
						acquiring more university credentials in the decades subsequent to his completion of graduate
						school in engineering in
						1956. With four degrees - a Bachelor of Science and a Master’s in Civil Engineering, a Bachelor
						of Arts in English, and
						a Master’s in Chinese linguistics and literature - Wong had devoted significant investment in
						academic training as well,
						which yielded at least two theses that had been evaluated with publishable quality, which are
						included
						in the personal collection of reknown Chinese American historian and writer, Him Mark Lai.
						Furthermore, Wong
						had also published research studies in his field of expertise in engineering. Only one of such
						publications is collected at
						this time of writing, however. Any future finding of his other works in this field will be
						added as pdf files accordingly.</p>

					<p>Other miscellaneous writings should also be mentioned. Between 1946 to 1948, Wong served as
						proofreading and translation
						staff for <em>The Nationalist Daily</em>. These positions may also have extended the focus of
						writing
						into a columnist for movie
						reviews. As a result, Wong had written nearly two dozens of movie reviews for various
						newspapers in Chinatown.</p>

					<p>As of now, only a few works are collected on this page. The prologue of Wong’s novella, <em>The
							Song
							of Immigrant Sons and
							Daughters</em>, may be translated to be included on this page in the future.</p>
