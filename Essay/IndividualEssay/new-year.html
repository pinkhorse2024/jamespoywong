                <h2><b>新年</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <p>时间是以老人为象征，老的和旧的都不是人们所喜爱的东西，故此我们在长久时间的过程中，常分成许多段落，每一个段落的开始，都加上 “新” 的名词，以 “新”
                    来代表希望，从希望生出活力，以活力来争取较丰富的生命。</p>

                <p>由新年我们联想到新的生命，大概生命不是沿着平直的路线进行，却需要不断的刺激，在流波般的起伏下，在弃旧迎新下而前进。</p>

                <p>为什么我们偏要喜新厌旧呢？ 难道过去的一切，真是如此空虚，丝毫不值得纪念吗？</p>

                <p>我得以承认，发掘古旧的坟墓，来引起自己的悲哀，是愚蠢的行为。 因此每当我对镜子的时候，我并不因为面上皱纹的增加，而叹息青春之消逝。 我时时所追问的是： “我就是这样的吗？”
                    但当我怨着现在未有多大成就时，过去的痕迹，总映在我的眼前。
                    额角上一个突起的瘤，每使我回想起许多年前的新年来。</p>

                <p>那时我还未学会穿成人的鞋子，我还没有忧虑，我还在家中偷钱，还会干出恶作剧的事情。 新年放假，我和几个同学，决定乘脚踏车游玩。 清晨即起，胡乱在家中吃了早饭，四人一齐出发。</p>

                <p>我刚学会技巧乘车的，但他们三人已远在前方，我心中一慌，失了平衡， 倒了下来。 在越秀路上，我设法再上车，无如自己腿短，摇了几摇再坠了下来。 爬起身，觉得头上所流的不是汗，急以手抚额，却是鲜红的一片。
                    我把黑色的制服帽来遮掩，但血还不断地涌出，于是一面推车，一面向前步行。</p>

                <p>路旁一个苦力，带我到附近一个地方。 许多儿童围拢着我，那里的人替我疗伤敷药。 血止了，他们没有问及我的姓名和地址，只安慰地告诉我，一切都无事了。</p>

                <p>现在这件事和额上的伤痕一样的显明。 虽然在一段路程中，个人自寻快乐，但世人并非完全希望你死亡。 在你挣扎倒下来的时候，虽然有许多人袖手旁观，但也有不少诚恳的助你一臂之力。
                    在这个并非十全十美的人间，每一个人不敢担保自己的地位永远稳固，不敢担保没有倒下来的时候。 只有大家合作，才能将整个人类，从仅足糊口的阶段，提到比目前较高的水准上去。</p>

                <p>新年也不过是明年的旧年，只有前进，才能保持永新，保持希望之火。</p>

            <div id="Section3">
                <p>
                <h2><b>New Year</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Time is symbolized by the elderly. Old age or old stuff are not the things adored by people.
                    Therefore, we often divide
                    different segments of time over its long process. At the beginning of each phase we add the word
                    “new” to represent
                    hope, and have hope generate vitality, and with vitality we strive for a fuller life.</p>

                <p>We associate the New Year with a new life. Perhaps life does not progress on a straight and even
                    path. It needs
                    continuous stimulation as in the movement of waves to move forward by shedding the old and welcoming
                    the new.</p>

                <p>Why are we inclined to like the new and dislike the old? Is the past really so empty that it is
                    worthless of
                    remembrance?</p>

                <p>I am able to admit digging up an ancient, old grave to incite my sorrow is a foolish act. Therefore,
                    whenever I face a
                    mirror I would not lament the fading of youth due to the increase of wrinkles. What I constantly ask
                    is: “This is what I
                    am?” When I complain I have not yet accomplished much, traces of the past would always flash through
                    my mind. The bump
                    on my forehead always leads me to recall one New Year many years ago.</p>

                <p>At that time, I had not yet learned how to wear adult shoes; I had no worry; I had continued to steal
                    money from home
                    and I would still do mischievous things. During the New Year holiday break, a few classmates and I
                    decided to travel
                    around the city on bicycles. I got up early in the morning, hastily ate breakfast at home, and four
                    of us headed out
                    together.</p>

                <p>At the time, I had recently learned how to ride the bicycle, so three of them had taken off far
                    ahead. I got nervous and
                    lost my balance and fell on the street of Yue Xiu Road. I tried to get on the bike again, but
                    regrettably my legs were
                    too short and I swayed a few times and fell again. Climbing back up, I realized what was running
                    down my head was not
                    sweat. Anxiously I touched my forehead and my hand was covered in bright red. I used my black
                    uniform hat to cover it,
                    but the blood continued to spill out. So I had to push the bike while walking forward.</p>

                <p>A coolie led me to a nearby place. Many children were surrounding me and someone there applied
                    medicine on my wound.
                    While the bleeding stopped, they didn’t even ask my name or where I lived, but just comforted me by
                    saying everything is
                    alright now.</p>

                <p>This event is now as clear in my mind as the wound on my forehead. Although people seek their own
                    happiness in a certain
                    stage of their life journeys, not all people wish death to come upon you. And when you struggle and
                    fall, there are
                    still quite many people who would sincerely give you a helping hand, albeit many others would just
                    stand around watching
                    with crossed arms. In this world that is not perfect, no one can guarantee his own position to
                    remain forever secure,
                    nor would he dare to assure there won’t be a time of his collapse. We must collaborate in order to
                    elevate the entire
                    human race from the stage of barely making ends meet to the relatively higher standard than the
                    current time.</p>

                <p>New Year is just the old year of next year. Only by moving forward can we preserve the perpetual
                    newness as well as the
                    flame of hope.</p>
