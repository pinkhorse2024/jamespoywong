                <h2><b>唁言</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <p>去年聖誕的前夕，我到綱紀慎教堂，參加一個不相識的女郎的喪禮。 我不是朋友，也不是親戚，因為我已說過和她素不相識的，我只是一個以為青年人都不應該死去的人。 有着這種思想，我要在死者被埋葬之前再看她一面。
                </p>

                <p>死者姓陸名持貞，年方十八歲，是患了急症而死去的。 記得死者在去世之前，出現於這花園角上的小小教堂中，還不過是年把的事。 當年戰雲未散，壯士遠在國外，故此在教堂中的風琴前，剩下詩班中的寥寥幾個女子。
                </p>

                <p>一個星期日，我發現了一個新而悅耳的聲音，浮在其他的聲音上面，這就是我第一次知道陸女士的存在了。 其後，她常常獨唱，而且我又知道她担任主日學的教師。
                    對於音樂，除了欣賞之外，我是門外漢，但是總覺得她的聲音有着誠懇和莊嚴的成份。
                    這聲音我很快就熟習起來，從合唱的眾聲中，自然底辨出，而且總覺這聲音獨特清晰。</p>

                <p>可是這一位為上帝而工作的青年，却不幸早夭。 自從她的棺木封合之後， 我每到教堂中，聽着詩班的歌唱，總覺得缺少了些什麼，而這就是她的歌聲。 我曾數次憧憬着她的幻影，可是總無法找回已失去的聲音。
                    我相信有許多人從她的聲音那裏，得到過安慰，從她的聲音那裏，受過無數次的祝福。 故勿論是為上帝而工作，或是為人類直接而工作，只要是給與，總該值得稱讚的。</p>

                <p>她是一個身體健美的女郎，誰也料不到她會比自己先去世，然而在她的短短十八年的生命中，她的成就，或者比許多八十歲的人的貢獻還大。 可惜的是，她以少女的身分，來到人間， 却還以少女的身分而離去。
                    像一顆種子的生長，在開花的時候萎折，不能夠結實。</p>

                <p>我相信，惡劣勢力，無論怎樣的強橫，總不會永遠不變，所以我不怕這些對人類有貢獻的人，偏要早死，却恐怕他們不來。</p>

                <p>約在二千年前，伯利恆產生一個偉人，在他之前及在他之後，人間無時不有願意貢獻的志士，來來去去。 每當我想起一個死人的出生，生死的界限，就很難劃分了。
                    在今日，聖誕不獨是宗教上有意義的日子，而且進為舉世和平及善良的象徵，只要地球上的人，在這一天作一年一度的深思，人對真理也接近許多。</p>

                <p>我之所以草草地刻下這片墓誌銘，目的不過是向失望的人，報導世間上還有貢獻一切的人存在。 精神並不隨著肉體而消逝，正如聖誕的精神，還保存到今日。
                    我們的努力就是怎樣將它移植到沙漠般的人心裏，願有一天，聖誕的冬樹， 生長在地球的每一角。
                    願它的精神， 為人類所接納。</p>

                <p>真理是這麼奇怪的東西，像一座高大的鐘樓，陷入濃霧中，你可以聽到它的鐘聲，你知道它的有在，可是你看不見它。</p>

                <h2><b>Condolences</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>On Christmas Eve last year, I went to Congregational Church to attend a funeral of a lady of whom I
                    don’t know. I am not
                    a friend nor am I a relative, as I have said we are not acquaintances. I am just someone who
                    believes no young people
                    should have died. With such thinking I want to take a last look at her before she is buried.</p>

                <p>The deceased’s surname is Lu, named Chizheng, eighteen years of age, and died in an emergency
                    condition. I remember just
                    over a year ago before she passed away, she appeared in this small church located at the public park
                    in Chinatown. At
                    the time the war was still going on, and the warriors were in far away countries, so in church the
                    choir in front of the
                    organ remained with just a few ladies.</p>

                <p>On a Sunday, I discovered a pleasant new voice flowing above the rest. That was the first time I knew
                    of Miss Lu.
                    Thereafter she often sang solo, and I learned that she was also a teacher in Sunday school. With
                    regard to music, apart
                    from appreciation I was just a layman, but I generally sensed her voice as expressive of sincerity
                    and solemnity. I
                    quickly became familiar with this voice and naturally could distinguish it from the rest of the
                    choir. I always felt
                    this voice was uniquely clear and distinct.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, this youth who worked for God died young. After her casket was closed, every time I
                    went to church and
                    listened to the choir singing, I always felt that something was missing. It was her singing voice. I
                    have tried a few
                    times to imagine her presence, but never could I find her lost voice. I believe many people have
                    found comfort and
                    countless blessings in her voice. So regardless whether she was working for God or directly for
                    humankind, her offering
                    was worth our praise.</p>

                <p>She was a physically healthy lady, and nobody would have expected she would depart before oneself.
                    But in her eighteen
                    years of short life, her contribution may be greater than many people 80 years of age. It is pitiful
                    that she came to
                    this world as a young girl, and she departed still as a young lady. She was just like the growing of
                    a seed that
                    withered after flowering and could not bear fruit.</p>

                <p>I believe regardless of how strong the evil force is, it won’t forever be unchanged. So I am not
                    afraid that those who
                    could contribute would die young; I just fear they don’t come to this world.</p>

                <p>2000 years ago a great man was born in Bethlehem. Before and after him, there was never a lack of
                    aspiring people
                    willing to dedicate their lives. Whenever I think of the birth of a dead person, I find it very
                    difficult to demarcate
                    the line between life and death. Today Christmas is not only a day that has religious meaning, it
                    has progressed to
                    become a symbol of peace and goodness in the whole world. Only if people in the world would reflect
                    once a year on this
                    day, they would be closer to the truth.</p>

                <p>The reason I draft out and inscribe this epitaph in my mind is because I want to share with those
                    disappointed in the
                    world that there still exist people who dedicate all they have. The spirit does not die with the
                    flesh, just like the
                    spirit of Christmas is still being preserved today. Our effort is to transplant it into the
                    desiccated human hearts, and
                    hope the Christmas tree will grow in every corner on earth and its spirit will be accepted by all
                    humanity.</p>

                <p>Truth is such a peculiar thing. It is like a tall bell tower that sinks into the thick fog. While you
                    can hear the sound
                    of the bell, you know it is there, but you cannot see it.</p>
