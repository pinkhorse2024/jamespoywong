                <h2><b>徬徨</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>广州市一个十八岁的朋友，写了一封信，告诉我说他现在徬徨在一条已知是通不到任何地方的路上，却不知如何是好。</p>

                <p>你可曾徬徨过吗？ 你也许会反问我，在这梦幻般的美国中，也会有徬徨的事情吗？ 我真羡慕你，一个能问这话的人我认为是幸福的。 苦的是人们在无聊中徬徨着的时候，自己却完全不知道。
                    在街上东奔西走地忙个不了的人，大多是不知道自己正在做的是什么。
                    所以忙的人生不是充实的人生，不自觉的生活也不是没有徬徨的。</p>

                <p>人生来必定要有一个目标。 这目标要能够征服自己那个不餍足的心，不然，徬徨自会偷进来，而且不愿离开。 徬徨的结果是苦恼，苦恼的结果是悲观，悲观的结果是生命的结束了。
                    我不是说这人会结束了自己的生命，但是这人已杀了那个有点意味的「我」了。
                    没有去路的人会徬徨，去路太多的人也会徬徨。 徬徨是生命转移的关键，你若能征服它，前程就无限，快乐就无穷，可是没有几个人真正地能够征服它。</p>

                <p>青年人比较易于徬徨，老年人每尽力规避它。 看来徬徨似乎与感情无关， 实在是一件极不空虚的事，一个不应逃避的问题。</p>

                <p>我所说的那个朋友，为什么会徬徨起来呢？ 原来他是沦陷区中受过铁蹄压迫的孩子，爱国的热情并不是低沉。（中国青年人，大多数的感情容易冲动，每每把救国的全责负在自己一个人的肩上。
                    可是冷冰冰的社会偏使他压死了这条心。）羊城失陷之后，他和其他无数的沦陷区少年一样，没有走进所谓自由空气的大后方，而且还继续读书。
                    在敌人之下读书，并不是为了愿做奴隶，因为他的爱国心比你我在这离开祖国数千里外的避难所还要强些。
                    如果有什么值得惭愧的事，你和我应该先要担受。 可是现在他说： “政府下令要学校解散，于是这么多的学生便徬徨起来。 政府连国家未来的柱石也不要了，他们说我们是伪学生，没有资格在真的学校里读书。”</p>

                <p>他还寄给我一段剪下来的新闻。 【学生召开大会讨论驱逐办法，及推选代表，请求王校长拒收之外，并联名呈请张特派员，迅速处置。 前日该校七院代表，复在石牌召集大会，通过实行驱逐伪生离校。
                    本市一般教育界人士，咸望当局对此妥予处理，以免酿成严重后果。】</p>

                <p>谁是伪呢？ 我不知道。 我永远都难于了解人称的特有名词。 教育的本意是把恶的改为善，绝不是演架子的场所。 如果连这千万的孩子都不理了，将来他们会有益于社会吗？
                    那么出生在铁蹄下的儿女，岂不是无辜地负了永不能消除的罪名么？
                    难道我们要回到古代去？</p>

                <p>我能想到这班无辜的同胞底痛苦，你可曾知道你也在徬徨中而不自觉吗？ 我不愿唤起使你感到的痛苦，但是你迟早有一天会知道，那时你自内心发出的责备，会使你受到更大的痛苦。 你可曾徬徨过吗？
                    如果你在黄昏过后，迷失在密林中，那时就会知道一点类似这徬徨的滋味了。</p>

                <p>
                <h2><b>Wandering In Uncertainty</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>An eighteen year old friend in Guangzhou wrote a letter telling me he is wandering in uncertainty on
                    a knowingly
                    impassable path, but does not know what to do.</p>

                <p>Have you ever felt lost? Perhaps you would ask me in turns how could one feel lost in this
                    fantastical America. I truly
                    admire you, for one who could ask such a question is indeed in bliss. The agony lies in how people
                    are completely not
                    aware of themselves being lost in their boredom. Most of the people running around on the streets
                    seeing no end to their
                    busyness don’t know what they are doing. So a busy life is not a fully enriched life, and an unaware
                    life is not freed
                    of being lost.</p>

                <p>A person being born into life should have a goal, and this goal must be able to conquer one’s greedy
                    mind. Otherwise, a
                    sense of uncertainty will sneak in and unwilling to leave. The result of uncertainty is agony; the
                    result of agony is
                    pessimism; and the result of pessimism is the termination of life. I am not saying such a person
                    will end one’s own
                    life, but this person has killed the “I” that is embodied with meanings. Those without a path will
                    become uncertain, and
                    those having too many paths will also be wandering around. A sense of uncertainty is the key factor
                    impacting one’s
                    life. If you can conquer it your future journey will be boundless, and your happiness will be
                    immense. However, not many
                    people can truly conquer it.</p>

                <p>Comparatively, young people easily fall into a sense of uncertainty while old people always try their
                    best to avoid it.
                    The sense of uncertainty is seemingly related to emotions, and it really is not just an empty
                    matter. It is a problem we
                    should not avoid.</p>

                <p>Why did the friend I mentioned start feeling lost? It turns out he is a child subjugated to the
                    suppression of the iron
                    hoofs of the oppressors in the occupied territory during the war. His passion for patriotism is not
                    shallow. (The
                    emotions of most young Chinese people are inclined to be impetuous. They often take the whole
                    responsibility of recusing
                    the country solely on their own shoulders. But the apathetic society compels to suppress this desire
                    into termination.)
                    After the fall of Guangzhou, he and numerous other youths in the occupied territory did not go to
                    the interior regions
                    with so-called freedom, and they continued going to school. They studied under the enemies not
                    because they want to be
                    slaves, but because their love of the country is stronger than you and I who are in this sanctuary
                    thousands of miles
                    away from our motherland. If there is anything to be shameful of, you and I ought to bear it first.
                    Now he says, “The
                    government ordered the school to dissolve, so many students are feeling lost with uncertainty. The
                    government has
                    abandoned the future upholders of the nation. They said we are puppet students and we are not
                    qualified to study in the
                    real school.”</p>

                <p>He also sent me a clipping of newspapers. It reads: “The students held a meeting to discuss the
                    approach to resolve the
                    problem of expulsion. In addition, they selected representatives to appeal for Principal Wang not to
                    accept the order
                    and they jointly petitioned special Envoy Zhang to quickly resolve the problem. The day before
                    yesterday,
                    representatives of seven universities again held a meeting in Shipai and passed a resolution to
                    expel the puppet
                    students from school. Most leading figures in the field of education within the city express their
                    hope for the
                    authority to properly handle this matter to avoid it ending in a grave result.”</p>

                <p>Who is a puppet? I don’t know, as I always have difficulty in understanding those special nouns
                    pertaining to human
                    titles. The purpose of education is to transform evil into good; it is not a place to display
                    affectation for being
                    important. If they don’t even care for these tens of thousands of children, would the children be
                    beneficial to society
                    in the future? Then, for those who were born under the iron hoofs, wouldn’t they have to carry the
                    criminal charge
                    without being guilty? Are we returning to ancient times?</p>

                <p>I could imagine the pain felt by our innocent fellow countrymen. Have you ever known that you have
                    felt a sense of
                    uncertainty without awareness of it? I don’t want to evoke the pain you feel, but sooner or later
                    you would know one
                    day. By then the reproach from your heart will cause you more pain. Have you ever felt lost? If you
                    were lost in a
                    jungle after sundown, you would know a bit of the similar sense of being <em>

        <p class="p2"><sup>1</sup>The Chinese title of this piece is “Panghuang”徬徨. There is no good English
            equivalent to the word <em>panghuang</em>,
            which literally means to walk back and forth with a sense of uncertainty. The term may imply, by extension,
            meanings of
            anxiety, disturbance, restlessness, fear, sense of loss, etc. As a part of speech, panghang could be used as
            both a verb
            and an adjective. While the same word is used throughout in the original text, the translator selects
            different variants
            of panghuang meaning based on each context in the text.
