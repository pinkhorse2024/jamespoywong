                <h2><b>最后一课</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <p>热情地紧抱着钟楼旁的古旧屋子之老滕，上次在我留意它的时候，还是青绿的一片，现在突然地秃了，露出一副难看的棕色粗枝，一个学期就这样结束了。</p>

                <p>当教授结束这个学期最后一课的时候，总有几句收场话，或以导师的态度来勉励，或以年长的身分来作最后的人生教训，或以无所谓的语气来说个笑谈。 学生们照例回以掌声，代表一个学期来所受教益的答谢。</p>

                <p>学校有着一个相当长久的存在期间，学生和学校的直接关系，不过是四年。 这四年的阶段，有些是愉快的，有些却是痛苦的。
                    因为个人的环境，背景和思想不同，一些是家庭条件美满的，可以安心地读书，而且有过剩的时间来参加各种活动，一些是有家庭的负担，或要供给自己，课本以外的生活是没法享受的。
                    纯粹为学问而生活的没有很多人，故此在某一种意念或压力较强的时候，就要中途退学，或做工，或结婚，或潦倒。</p>

                <p>无论是毕业或是退学，一般来说是独自踏上人生路途的开端，最后一课就是生命的一个标记。
                    有人从此继续去追求真理，有人单谋个人的幸福，也还有大多数的人给别人去践踏，践踏中呻吟，在痛苦中发出片刻的欢笑，也在绝望中死亡，
                    在一生的课程中得不到一个教训。 另有些人以教训来鞭策自己，追求那丰富的生命。 这些人，最后一课永远不是最后的教训。</p>

                <p>人们在最后一课后，就结束了领受教训的虚心。 我常常觉得受教育越多的人，偏见也越多，歧视的观念也越强，亦最不愿领受教训。</p>

                <p>但是最后一课又给他们以自信力，不能再希望在疑惑之时依赖别人的指导，他们必须走自己的路！</p>
                </p>

                <h2><b>The Last Class</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>With great zeal the old vine tree is clinging to the old building at the side of the bell tower. It
                    was green all over
                    the last time I paid attention to it, and now suddenly it has become bare, revealing the very
                    unsightly brown and thick
                    branches. A semester has thus ended.</p>

                <p>When the professor finishes the last class of this semester, he always says the last few words of
                    denouement. He may
                    take the attitude of a mentor to encourage students, or the role of an elder to give a last lecture
                    on life, or he may
                    just nonchalantly crack a joke. The students would respond with customary applause as their
                    gratitude for their learning
                    throughout the semester.</p>

                <p>This school has been in existence for quite a long period, but the direct relation between students
                    and the school is
                    only four years. During this phase of four years, some of the times are happy and some are painful.
                    Due to differences
                    in personal background, situation and thinking, those students with comfortable family situations
                    would feel at ease
                    studying. They also have extra time to participate in other activities. Some have the burden of
                    taking care of their
                    families or have to support themselves, so they cannot enjoy any other kind of living outside of
                    their textbooks. Not
                    many people live exclusively for knowledge. Therefore, when there is a certain thought or pressure
                    that is too forceful,
                    they would drop out of school and go to work, or get married, or be down-and-out.</p>

                <p>Regardless of whether one would graduate or drop out, generally speaking, it is the beginning of
                    one’s independent
                    embarkation in life. Thus the last lesson is a landmark for life. Some people would thence continue
                    pursuing truth, some
                    would solely seek their own happiness, and most people would be exploited by others. Those being
                    exploited would moan
                    and groan in the process and have a moment of heartfelt laughter while in pain. They would also die
                    in despair and would
                    not learn any single lesson in the course of a lifetime. There are others who would use the lesson
                    to discipline
                    themselves in their pursuit of a fuller life. To these people the last class is never a final
                    lesson.</p>

                <p>After the last class people will close up their humble minds on accepting teaching. I often feel the
                    more educated one
                    is, the more one is biased and the stronger of one’s notions of prejudice. They are also the ones
                    most unwilling to
                    accept exhortation.</p>

                <p>But the last lesson will give people confidence, as they no longer could hope for guidance from
                    others when they are in
                    doubt. They have to take their own paths.</p>
