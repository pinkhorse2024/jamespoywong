  <h1>
    <p style="color: #4066a3;">
      Selected (Short) Short Stories Published in 1940s and 1970s</p>
  </h1>

  <div id="Section3">
    <p>In addition to the 30 pieces of short stories and 1 novella written in the 1940s, James Poy Wong also published
      25 pieces
      of short fiction between 1975 to 1976. All fiction written in the 40s was translated and included on this page,
      and only
      a few of the 70s were selected. More of the 70s may be included in the future, including possibly a translation
      of the
      prologue of the novella <em>Songs of Immigrant Sons and Daughters</em> 儿女之歌 may be included in the future.</p>

    <p>In brief, Wong's short stories in the 40s reflect singly and through intertextual discourse the following
      subjects and
      themes:
      separation from motherland, life of diaspora, hardship of immigration, life and revolution in China, sexual
      repression
      and bachelor’s society in Chinatown America, overseas marriage, cultural conflicts in post WWII Chinese-American
      marriage, immigration education, fatherhood, patriarchy, feminist thoughts, social and occupational
      discrimination,
      wars, generation gap, et cetera. The pieces written in the 70s shift subjects to life changes from the old era
      to the
      new generation.</p>
