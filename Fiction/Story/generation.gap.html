                <h2><b>代隔</h2></b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>「我不要你这样的儿子，你要走你的就走好了，以后不要再回到这里来。」 老胡发怒起来，平常已经像金鱼般凸出的眼睛，现在几乎要抛了出来。

                <p>「我也不承认你这样的父亲。」小胡的火气也够大，说完就大力地把门砰的关上，走了。</p>

                <p>老胡慢慢地把身体拖回客厅来，像包袱般一鼓抛在沙发上，还在忿忿的喘着气。</p>

                <p>胡太太在他们父子吵闹的时候躲避在厨间，现在才敢跑出来，站在丈夫的身旁， 抚摸了一下他那长度不及寸半而开始斑白的短发，低声地说： 跟以前一样，他是会回来的。</p>

                <p>老胡动也不动。 这场面也演过不只一次了， 但是从来没有像这次那么剧烈。 他那体重仅及父亲半数的儿子，以前也决不敢说出不承认爸爸这样忘恩负义的说话来的。</p>

                <p>老胡的个子不高，仅五尺四寸，但是体格十分结实，在二埠附近的园口长大。
                    那里的中国人只是他们的一家，已经是第三代的华侨了，所以老胡对小时学讲唐话的印象十分模糊，虽然现在白日有时中午要来唐人埠吃他喜爱的唐餐，但是叫来叫去也不过是学得半三不四（邑） 的一味「叉烧豆腐饭」吧了。
                </p>

                <p>老胡爱运动，人虽细小，但是打起美国式的足球来，
                    冲锋陷阵，有过人的英勇，所以成为了中学的明星，还被选为全埠高中队的前线选手。从一般以体重二百磅以上才合格的前锋蛮牛的标准来看，他能入伍，的确成为了埠上的美谈，更何况他还是一个矮仔中国人呢？

                <p>老胡进史丹福大学主修商科的时候，并没有放弃他所爱好的运动。不过大学的波牛人才济济，他就是体格方面吃亏，结果甲队落选了，只得参加名声大差的乙队。乙队的活动，不过是跟其他细小的学校玩玩比赛，或是在甲队正式比赛之前，先出场来作一个陪衬的小赛罢了。虽然如此，但是在乙队中，老胡却是一个主要的人物，他是前线中位的发球员。
                    他俯下来把球从自己的屁股下递给主将后，对方四五条大牛立刻就向他扑压下来，每次老胡都顶挡得着，从人堆中很快地就爬了起来，继续用他的头凶猛的去撞击那些比他大上最少是一倍的番鬼仔。</p>

                <p>老胡从史大毕业后，在大埠一家保险公司里任职，已经甚少回乡，结婚后，差不多可以算作本地人了。保险公司请中国人做事，当时还是属于稀罕的事情，不过老胡打足球就是二流的，也还有点名气，而且一向和外国人混得来，所以七八年后居然也升了两次，很受一般西人同事的羡慕，更正确的说是受到他们的嫉忌。
                </p>

                <p>老胡的表止虽然不像是什么中国人的，但是大概因为种氏的遗传，倒有点广东人坚忍的性格，从来都不怕白人的辱骂。 他也有着老华侨那种不傲慢的态度，因此和人的相处，勿论是中是西， 就是缺乏热情，倒也算是过得去的。

                <p>一天，老胡向老板提出辞职，老板反而诚意的要挽留他。老板问他是否找到了一份薪金更优的工作，要是如此，老板是愿意照样加薪的。老胡坦白地告诉他的老板，说他着实是做厌了，想到外面去做点自己的生意，实在是没有其他职位高就的。老板向来也知道老胡素有志气，进取心很强，终不是一个会久寄人篱下的小子。
                    所以老板不仅是拉拉手，说句「相识何其短」的应酬说话了事，他却委任老胡做该公司在华埠的总代理。</p>

                <p>这是出乎老胡意外的好机会，他想不到自己的生意起头会来得如此容易。不过老胡也不肯稍怠，日夜登门推销燕梳。 果然不出五年，他由一人独当的小办公室，发展而成为一个有十二人替他工作的公司了。</p>

                <p>老胡成功的秘诀，除了刻苦耐劳之外，倒也要靠点计谋。 他请推销员的时候，不问工作的经验，最重要的条件是亲戚多和朋友多。 因为老胡的佣金特别优厚，所以新员一开始就落力向自己的亲戚朋友处猛推，但是两年后，
                    成绩迅速的衰退后，老胡就不客气的辞人了。
                    被辞的推销员，还只埋怨自己的不好呢？ 推销员更换的越多，老胡的利润也越加膨胀起来。 现在他还差两年才五十岁，已经拥有入息房产五座，投资的公司大小十余家， 而且自己所住的房屋，在市外三十里的半山上，
                    置有游泳池，
                    虽不算是真正的名贵住区，可也不是寻常做工的人之家了。</p>

                <p>没有人会否认老胡的成功是他自己刻苦耐劳产生的结果。 他每天的工作相等于别人的两倍，星期日也不肯休息， 二十多年来都不曾到过什么地方去休过假的。
                    如果说他请人辞人的办法是存下欺骗的话，那也不见得如是，因为如果推销员能够继续多产下去的时候，他是会乐意留用他的。 有些人还认为他肯给没有经验的新员就业的机会，的确是一件难得的好事。
                    当今之世，谁还愿意自己花钱去教人做事的呢？</p>

                <p>老胡对自己的多财，虽不像那些到处宣传自己「财主」的人那般虚浮， 但是心里却也不免暗地欢喜，常常在家里向老婆和那唯一的儿子做点自我的赞扬。

                <p>这个独子从小就觉得父亲是自己理想中的英雄，而他自己对于打波的兴趣也很浓厚。 可惜的是，发育后长得比父亲还要矮点，而身裁又像母亲那般削瘦。
                    所以他的父亲早就放弃了希望他成为足球健将的奢望，转而鼓励他去学棒球。
                    果然小胡在这方面的成绩不错，很容易就被选上小棒球队去了。 老胡知道，小胡打得好的话， 做个职业球员是可以发大财的。 就算不够资格的话，或者还可以拿到一个大学的运动员奖学金来，
                    这样最低限度也可以替父亲省上数万元的教育费了。</p>

                <p>等到小胡进大学的时候，到底还是老胡自己拔荷包缴学费的。 其实要拿奖学金的话，也用不着拿运动员的，因为小胡读书聪明，是高中毕业的十名高材生之一，但是因为老胡的入息太好了，才得不到穷家子弟可以享受的名誉。
                    不过，老胡也觉得这个儿子是值得栽培的，更何况儿子听从了他的主张，修起商科来。老胡的脑海中，常常浮现着「胡家父子公司」的商标。</p>

                <p>小胡进入加大，寄宿学校，离家也不过是五十里路，第一个学期差不多每一周末都回家来。 但是从第二个学期开始，回家的次数逐渐减少， 到第三年就甚少回来了。 初时的理由是功课忙，后来又加上了课外的活动。
                    老胡想到当年自己课外活动
                    打球）也很多，以至学分受损。 但是小胡现在却能始终保持着差不多是全甲等的平均分数，而且有些科目竟能拿到「甲加」的超级分数，因此老胡也不便多加责问了。
                    不过，亲戚朋友们有儿女读加大的，不时流露点关于小胡课外活动的情形，似乎跟老胡想像的并不相同。

                <p>「小胡，听说你现在已经改修法科预科了，是吗?」
                    老胡对儿子放弃商科并无怪责之意，他知道进法学院的要求甚高，能进法学院已经是一件很荣幸的事情了，更何况将来做父亲的，还有一个可亲可信的律师来保护他一生劳苦的积眝呢。</p>

                <p>「是的，父亲，我觉得法科的前途比较好，我对赚钱的事没有什么兴趣，懂得法律，我可以为社会服务。」</p>

                <p>「呀？」</p>

                <p>「我过去在是市郊区生长的时候，视线着实是太低了。 人到底不该尽只是为了自己的个人的享受而活的。」</p>

                <p>「这是什么话？你应该先为自己的前途着想，学法律也是好的。 做律师找钱比卖燕梳容易，也更体面。」</p>

                <p>小胡觉得没有谈下去的必要。</p>

                <p>亲戚朋友们又很热心的传来谣言，说亲眼看见小胡站在华埠的街头派传单，而且还常常看见他在干尼街的土库底出入。</p>

                <p>「小胡，你在唐人埠干的是什么？」老胡对儿子已经不再客气了。</p>

                <p>「增加见识，获取人生的经验，找寻自己，建立自己的前程。」</p>

                <p>「不要跟我说这些废话！我是送你去卜技利读书的，你在那些贫民窟里干什么？ 这不是你应该到的地方。凡是有能力的人都设法离开这个污秽的地方， 都要走到市郊有阳光， 有体面的地方来.」</p>

                <p>「这市郊的生活是无聊的生活，人与人之间是应该有社会的关系的。你把我养成了一个不中不西，不伦不类的经济动物，使我不仅对自己的同类无法接触，结交和认识，连自己也不认识自己。
                    你看，我不会说中国话，连谈话都有了隔膜，又怎能够进一步去了解别一个中国人的感情呢？我们在一起吃饭的时候，我连筷子也不会拿。」</p>

                <p>「你不需要这样的朋友，你看我不是 。 。 。 。 」</p>

                <p>「你！」</p>

                <p>亲戚朋友们又很开心地传来谣言，说小胡现在担牌巡行示威，担红旗开会了。</p>

                <p>「你如果不停止参加这些地底活动，以后就休想希望我寄钱来供你读书。」 老胡发出最后的命令。老胡从来是一个言出必行的「波士」。但是对于这个火气不弱于他的儿子，却一点功效都没有。
                    不久，亲戚朋友们又把谣言传来，说小胡晚上在一间餐馆洗盘碗。
                    他们还故意啧啧的叹息，说快进法学院了，是一个十分聪明而值得培养的孩子呀。</p>

                <p>现在，小胡砰地关上门走了之后，老胡呆呆的坐在沙发上，数十年来克勤克苦建立起来的生命，忽然幻变了起来，觉得一切都在瓦解着。</p>

                <p>小胡出得门来，走了一段路，竖起了指头，等候着顺风车来。</p>

                </p>

            </div>

            <div id="Section3">
                <p>
                <h2><b>Generation Gap</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>“I don’t want the kind of son like you. If you want to go then just go, and don’t you come back
                    here.” When Old Hu is
                    mad, his eyes that usually look like bulging goldfish’s are nearly popping out now.</p>

                <p>“And I don’t acknowledge the kind of father like you.” Little Hu’s temper is just as hot. He slammed
                    the door shut as he
                    finished talking. He’s gone.</p>

                <p>Old Hu slowly dragged his body back to the living room and dropped into the sofa like a bundle
                    wrapped in cloth,
                    breathing through anger.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Hu hid in the kitchen while the father and son were fighting, and she only dared to come out
                    now. Standing by her
                    husband’s side, she stroked his half-inch short hair that was turning gray and said in a low voice,
                    “Just like before,
                    he will return.”</p>

                <p>Old Hu doesn’t move a bit. This scene has been in the play many times, but it was never this
                    dramatic. His son who is
                    not even half his weight had not dared in the past speaking out such an ungrateful saying as not
                    acknowledging his
                    father.</p>

                <p>Old Hu is not tall, only 5 foot 4 inches, but he has a sturdy physique as he grew up on a farm in
                    Sacramento. A third
                    generation overseas Chinese, he was the only Chinese family there at the time. So Old Hu is very
                    fuzzy about learning to
                    speak Cantonese when he was a kid. Now he often goes to Chinatown to have his favorite Chinese food
                    for lunch, but over
                    and over he could only order in pidgin Four-County dialect for a plate of “barbecue pork and tofu
                    over rice.”</p>

                <p>Old Hu loves sports. He may be small in size, but when he played football, he could break through the
                    opponent lines as
                    he was braver than others. So he became a star in high school, and was selected to join the all city
                    football team as a
                    member of the starting lineup. Considering the standard of the starting lineup to be like wild oxen
                    that are usually
                    over 200 pounds, his selection into the team was really a great story to be passed around among town
                    folks, let alone
                    the fact that he is a short Chinese.</p>

                <p>When Old Hu went to Stanford University and majored in business, he didn’t discard his love of
                    sports. There were many
                    talented athletes in the university, and his small physique became his disadvantage. As a result he
                    didn’t make it to
                    the first team and had to participate in the much less well known second team. The activities of the
                    second team were
                    competing with small colleges and playing as a side show before the first team officially started
                    its games. Even so,
                    Old Hu was an important player on the second team, and he was the center in the starting lineup.
                    After he bent down and
                    passed the ball to the commenting quarterback through his bottom, four or five big oxen of the
                    opposite team immediately
                    charged over and crushed down on him. But every time Old Hu held up well, and he quickly climbed out
                    from the pile. Then
                    he used his head to fiercely hit the foreign devils who were at least twice his size.</p>

                <p>After Old Hu graduated from Stanford, he found a job in an insurance company in San Francisco. He
                    seldom went back to
                    his motherland, and after he got married he almost could be considered as a native son now. It was a
                    rare event when an
                    insurance company hired a Chinese person at that time. Old Hu played football, even though it was on
                    a second team, he
                    still has some reputation. Besides, he always could get along with the westerners, so he was
                    promoted twice in seven or
                    eight years. He was envied by his fellow workers, or more accurately speaking, he was much resented.
                </p>

                <p>Old Hu in his outward behavior does not look much like Chinese, but he has the Cantonese
                    characteristic of steadfastness
                    and perseverance. He is never afraid of being insulted by white people. He also has the modest
                    attitude of the old
                    overseas Chinese, so he could get along with people whether they are Chinese or Westerners. Even
                    though he is lacking
                    enthusiasm, nevertheless he is good enough.</p>

                <p>One day, he told his boss he would quit the job. The boss earnestly wanted to keep him and asked him
                    whether he had
                    found a better paying job; he said if it is so he is willing to match it. Old Hu frankly told his
                    boss he really was
                    tired of the job and wanted to go out and start his own business, and that there was really no
                    better paying job. The
                    boss always knew that Old Hu had ambition with a strong desire to get ahead, and he was not a young
                    fellow willing to
                    live under someone’s roof for long. As a result, the boss would not just do the usual courtesy of
                    shaking hands and
                    saying “how short is our acquaintance.” On the contrary, the boss appointed Old Hu to be the General
                    Manager of the
                    Chinatown branch of the company.</p>

                <p>This is a good opportunity beyond Old Hu’s expectation, as he didn’t think it was so easy to start
                    his own business. So
                    he did not take it easy and continued pounding doors to sell insurance day and night. As a result,
                    in five years his
                    one-man small office developed into a company with twelfth people working for him.</p>

                <p>Besides being able to endure painstaking hardship, Old Hu also relied on some tactics. When he hired
                    a salesman, he
                    would not ask the person’s work experience, while the most important requirement was having many
                    relatives and friends.
                    Because Old Hu gave a specially high commission, the newly hired salesman would push very hard in
                    selling insurance to
                    his relatives and friends. But two years later, after his sales greatly dropped, Old Hu would
                    bluntly fire him and the
                    salesman could only blame himself for not being good enough. The more changes of salesman the
                    greater was his inflated
                    profit. He was just two years shy of fifty, but he owned five income properties and invested in more
                    than ten companies
                    in various sizes. His own house is on a hillside thirty miles from the city and is built with a
                    swimming pool. Although
                    it is not in a prestigious residential area, it is not a home for the ordinary working class people.
                </p>

                <p>Nobody would deny that Old Hu’s success is not the result of his own endurance of painstaking
                    hardship. He works twice
                    as hard as other people, and he is unwilling to rest on Sunday. He has not gone for a vacation trip
                    in more than 20
                    years. It is not quite right to say that his hiring and firing practice was intended to deceive,
                    because if a salesman
                    could continue his high production, Old Hu would be happy to keep him. Some people thought his way
                    of giving young
                    people employment opportunities without experience was a good thing, really hard to come by. In our
                    time who would be
                    willing to spend his own money to teach people how to work?</p>

                <p>Although Old Hu is not as shallow as others who boast wherever they go as being “rich men,” he can’t
                    help secretly
                    feeling happy in his heart. At home he often puts up some self-praising to his wife and his only
                    son.</p>

                <p>This only son since childhood has felt that his father is his ideal hero, and he himself is very
                    interested in playing
                    ball. Unfortunately, he grew up shorter than his father, while his frame is thin like his mother.
                    Therefore, very early
                    on his father had given up the wish of his son becoming a football star and turned to encouraging
                    him to practice
                    baseball. Sure enough Young Hu was pretty good at it, and he was selected into the little league of
                    the city’s baseball
                    team. Old Hu knew if Young Hu plays well, he can be a professional player and make big money. Even
                    if he isn’t good
                    enough, he can still get an athletic scholarship from a university, and he would at least save tens
                    of thousands in
                    tuition fees for his father.</p>

                <p>When Young Hu went to college, it was still Old Hu himself who had to pay the tuition. The fact is
                    that to get a
                    scholarship, Young Hu did not have to apply for athletic scholarship, because he was good in his
                    schooling. He was one
                    of the top ten outstanding students who graduated from his high school. However, Old Hu’s income was
                    too high, so he
                    couldn’t enjoy the merit that children from a poor family would have. Old Hu felt his son was worth
                    his support, and
                    furthermore, his son listened to his advice and majored in business. The sign “Hu’s Father and Son
                    Company” often popped
                    up in Old Hu’s mind.</p>

                <p>Young Hu attended the University of California and lived on the campus that was just 50 miles from
                    home. In the first
                    semester he went home every weekend. But from the second semester onward, he started to come home
                    less. By the third
                    year he seldom returned. At first the reason was being too busy studying, and later on, additional
                    reasons were having
                    too many extracurricular activities. Old Hu recalled in his time he also had many activities (such
                    as playing ball) and
                    the activities impacted his grades, while Young Hu has always maintained his good grades with almost
                    all straight A’s
                    and some courses being outstanding A+. Therefore, Old Hu did not further question his son. However,
                    children of his
                    relatives and friends who also attended UC have often leaked out rumors about Young Hu’s activities
                    outside of the
                    classroom. They seemed to be different from those that Old Hu had imagined.</p>

                <p>“I heard that you have changed your major to law, is that right?” Old Hu had no intention to scold
                    his son for dropping
                    out of business major. He knew the requirement to get into law school is very demanding, and being
                    able to enter the
                    School of Law is already an honor, let alone in the future, the father will have a close and
                    trust-worthy lawyer to
                    protect his savings from a lifetime laboring.</p>

                <p>“Yes, father, I feel that the career prospect of laws is better, and I have no interest in making
                    money. Knowing laws I
                    can serve society.”</p>

                <p>“What?”</p>

                <p>“I grew up in the suburbs, so my vision was really too narrow. After all, a person should not live
                    only for his own
                    enjoyment.”</p>

                <p>“What kind of talk is this? You should first think of your future. Studying laws is also good; being
                    a lawyer makes
                    money easier than selling insurance, and it also has more merit.”</p>

                <p>Young Hu felt there was no need to continue discussing.</p>

                <p>Again, relatives and friends enthusiastically passed around rumors about how they saw with their own
                    eyes that Young Hu
                    was standing at the street corner in Chinatown passing out leaflets. They said they often saw him
                    going in and out of a
                    basement on Kearney Street.</p>

                <p>“Young Hu, what are you doing in Chinatown?” Old Hu was no longer polite to his son.</p>

                <p>“To increase my knowledge, to gain experience in life, to find myself, and to establish my future.”
                </p>

                <p>“Don’t talk this kind of nonsense to me. I sent you to Berkeley to study, and what are you doing in
                    the poor’s ghetto?
                    This is not the place you should go. Everyone who has the ability will try to get out of this filthy
                    place and go to the
                    suburbs where there are sunshines and respect.</p>

                <p>“Life in the suburbs is dull living. Human relationships should have societal connections. You had
                    raised me into
                    neither a Chinese nor a Westerner, a nondescript economic animal, and it makes me not only unable to
                    relate and to make
                    friends with our kind, I don’t even know myself. You see, I don’t speak Chinese and I can’t even
                    have a continuous
                    conversation, so how could I advance to understand the feeling of a Chinese person? When we are
                    eating together, I don’t
                    even know how to hold the chopsticks.”</p>

                <p>“You don’t need this kind of friend. Don’t you see, I am not . . . . ”</p>

                <p>“You!”</p>

                <p>Again, relatives and friends were joyfully passing on the rumor, saying that Young Hu was carrying
                    slogan signs in a
                    protest march and a red flag to the meeting.”</p>

                <p>“If you don’t stop participating in these kinds of underground activities, don’t expect me to send
                    you money to support
                    your schooling any more.” Old Hu gave his final order. He is always a boss whose actions must follow
                    up with his words.
                    But in applying to his son who has just as high a temper as his, it has no effect whatsoever. Before
                    long, there were
                    again rumors coming from relatives and friends that Young Hu was washing dishes in a restaurant at
                    night. They also
                    purposely sighed with clicking tongues, saying that the child was almost ready to enter law school,
                    and such a very
                    smart child is worthy of support.</p>

                <p>Now, After Young Hu slammed the door and left, Old Hu lifelessly sat on the sofa dumbfounded. He
                    thinks of his life from
                    enduring poverty and bitterness through several tens of years, now suddenly and unpredictably, it
                    has started to change.
                    He feels everything is disintegrating.</p>

                <p>Young Hu comes out of the door, walks a distance, and sticks up his thumb, waiting to hitch a ride.
                </p>
