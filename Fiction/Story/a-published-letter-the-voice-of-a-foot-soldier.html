                <h2><b>一封公开的信： 一个步兵的呼声</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>各位读者：</p>

                <p>自从到达了法国之后就没有时间来写封较详细的信给你们了，虽然我知道你们很想听听军人的经历和感想，但是总抽不到空。 今日，名目上是和平日，但是砲火还是那般响着。
                    刚刚回来有点儿时间，我趁着天还未变黑来给你们写封信。 明天，我或许又他去。
                    总之，我们的行踪是无定的，闲时也无定的。</p>

                <p>在报章上以安闲的心来读新闻，常常会觉得战事进行的迟缓。 但是如果你要拿起枪杆到前线去把局面转好，就真是一件困难的事了。
                    德国的军队虽然已退回到自己的国土上了，但是他们还是决心死抗，使到我们的进展迟缓起来。
                    来到这里，整天下着雨，一连总有十几天，而且又冷又大风。 “狐穴” 又臭得可怜，有时连小便也不敢钻出头来，只得放在穴里。 罐头食品又不热 （无论如何， 都没有你们在家用的好）。
                    固然军队把我养成一个人，但是我们也天天过着野兽般的生活。
                    我们像猪一般地吃，蛇一般地走动，猴子一般地跳，狗一般地睡。 到了得到几个小时的假期，就在街上变成个豺狼了。 有时在战场上走了几里，深入了敌人的阵线，回头一看，同伴们不见了。 四面的枪声不停地扫射着。
                    我告诉你，我当时伏在地上装死。
                    你们笑我胆小吗？ 什么都由你们自便。 在这战场上我从来没有害怕过，我冷着脑袋来观看这人类的惨杀。 我不是一个英雄崇拜者，我不愿白白牺牲了这条虽然没有价值的命。
                    唐克车在我们的后面，常常引起德国的砲火轰击。
                    等到砲火太厉害的时候，这些唐克车有时会很快地冲上前，有时却飞般地退走，留下我们这些如蚁的可怜步兵来迎接战神送来的礼物。 有时我这样想：为什么在这样进步的机械化战争中，我们还少不了这两条易于疲倦的腿呢？
                </p>

                <p>德军一见战势不佳便投降，有时举起白旗，有时高呼朋友。 但有时他们也佯意投降，唤着朋友。 如果你钻出头来，那么你颗脑袋就会增加一位以上的住客了。</p>

                <p>我们每个战士都喜欢拾些手枪， 手镖， 制服等等做纪念品，但是有时也不值得。 我还记得上个星期有个 ‘沙阵’ 因为拾起一盒珍珠，结果不见了一只手。 原来德军安置一个 ‘伏弹雷’ 在这些纪念品上。
                    不过我们还是喜欢拾这些便宜东西，人类在这个畸形社会中养成的性格到底也很难立即改过来。 还好，我们是健忘的，可怕和残忍的事情， 一刻就在脑后的常开大门溜走了。</p>

                <p>如果你问一问任何一位战士是否愿意再回到前线去， 我们的回答会一样地说：永不愿意。 美国的步兵是世界上最舒适的步兵， 但是其中的苦处也是很难堪的。 想起在祖国抗战的军人， 我有时也惭愧起来。
                    如果世界上的人都经过我们现在这样的生活，
                    我万分深信人类便不会再有战争的。 但是人类到底是健忘的动物， 而且战争在许多人的心目中还是一件光荣的事。 上古，中古， 而至现代，英雄崇拜的毒还是这般深在人们的脑海中。
                    我有时诅骂世上每个人，但愿他们每个人都亲眼见到自己的一个爱人被惨杀。</p>

                <p>现在来说一说法国现在的大概情形吧。 受过砲火洗礼过的城市，简直变成一个瓦砾的废墟。相信今年的圣诞老人也因为找不到烟囱而不驾临这个地球了。
                    法国现在交通上的汽车很少，我们随时可以看到美丽的姑娘踏着脚踏车遨游。
                    说起女子，有些是和我们中国的女子一样很注重贞操的，但是好些确是名符其实的放荡，弄到花柳白浊比英伦的要多三倍。 这场战争完结以后，人类还要和这些漫延了的微菌大战一场呢。</p>

                <p>头发长了， 须也种出半寸， 在镜上一照， 几乎把我惊坏了。 怎么我这般难看呢？ 连我自己也认不清楚是谁， 好在没有情人来看我。</p>

                <p>你们在后方的青年，不要因为不能入伍而灰心。 我本人不但不讥笑你们，而且还要恭祝你们的幸运。 这场战争，如果你越看得少，越听得少，那么你就幸福了。
                    况且未来对于人类的工作还多呢！这场战争不会在砲火停息的那刹那就结束的。
                    以后你们的工作比我现在做的还要大呢！ 打胜仗所用的时间不过是十年以内的事，但是要维持和平需要世纪了。 如何缩短这个时间就是你们的责任了。 这个责任你们每人都应该自动负起，这样我们的血也不会白流的。
                    我们虽然被牺牲了，我们都愿争得一个有价值的代价。 虽然我们不是这时代的第一个，我们但愿是最后一个。 人类自有历史以来就不断地牺牲去渡进一个新的时代， 经过如许多的人命实验，曾牺牲了千千万万的生命，
                    现在已经临到先人和平目标的门前了。
                    你们，我请求你们，叩开这重门把整个人类带进去啊！</p>

                <p>我们现在最大的志愿是离开军队的生活，尤其是步兵。 但是做一日和尚打一日钟，做一日兵就得做一日工。 不理我愿意与不， 我已经有了工作负在身上。 我至今也不能放下我的责任，也非要完成使命不可。
                    假如有一天每个兵士都放下了枪不干而回家去，那么就不会有战争了。 但是我们还没有到这个时代。 目前人道主义是没用的， 因为人类自己愿意做奴隶。
                    现在唯一的方法就只有以这个战争来消灭所有的战争，所以还要先把这个战争结束。
                    因此我们要枪杆握得紧些， 而你们在后方也要买公债多些。 只有这样战争才可以早些结束，你们的爱人才可以归来，或许你们不会再见到现在天真活泼的儿子长大要送上战场当炮灰了。 想想吧！
                    谁愿意这些悲惨的历史重演呢？
                    我知道这个月尾起就是第六次的战债运动， 那么多买些公债吧！不理为的是什么，买了总不会错的。 你应该为你自己现在这样幸福的生活而多买几张百元的公债。 你不会因为买了公债而损失过什么。
                    反而你还获得很厚的利润。 你到底牺牲过什么呢？
                    来吧，朋友，为你的朋友归来的车票，再买一张百元的公债吧！</p>

                <p>朋友，当你回信给我的时候，不可忘记告诉我你已经买了几张百元的公债。</p>

                <p style="text-align:right;">你底朋友，<br>

                <h2><b>A published letter: The voice of a Foot Soldier</b></h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Dear readers,</p>
                <p>Since I arrived in France, I haven't had time to write a more detailed letter to you all. Although I
                    know you really
                    want to hear the experiences and thoughts of soldiers, I invariably can't find free time. Today is
                    de jure a peace day,
                    but the artillery fire is still so loud. I came back just now for a while, so I will write you a
                    letter before it gets
                    dark. Tomorrow, I may go elsewhere again. In short, our whereabouts are uncertain, and so is our
                    leisure time.</p>

                <p>If you read the news in the newspaper with a leisurely mind, you will often feel that the war is
                    proceeding slowly. But
                    if you want to pick up a gun and go to the front line to improve the situation, then it will be a
                    difficult matter.
                    Although the German troops have retreated to their own territory, they are still determined to
                    resist by all means,
                    which has slowed down our progress. When we came here, it rained all day for more than ten days in a
                    row, and it was
                    cold and windy. While the "fox hole" smelled so terribly, I sometimes didn't even dare to get out of
                    it to urinate, so I
                    had to put it in the hole. Canned food doesn't heat well (not as good as what you use at home
                    anyway). The army has
                    provided for me as a human being, but we still live a life of beasts every day. We eat like pigs,
                    move like snakes, jump
                    like monkeys, and sleep like dogs. Then when I obtain a few hours off, I turn into a jackal on the
                    street. Sometimes
                    after walking several miles on the battlefield and getting deep into the enemy's lines, I looked
                    back at once and found
                    that my companions had disappeared. Gunfire ceaselessly continued from all sides. I tell you, I was
                    lying on the ground
                    pretending to be dead. Would you laugh at me for being timid? However you will think, it’s up to
                    you. I have never been
                    afraid on this battlefield. I kept my head cold and watched and observed such brutal slaughtering of
                    human beings. I am
                    not a hero worshiper, and I do not want to purposelessly sacrifice this life even though it is
                    worthless. The tanks were behind us which often led to the bombardment of the Germans. When the
                    artillery fire
                    becomes too strong,
                    these tankers will sometimes quickly charge ahead, but sometimes they will swiftly retreat, leaving
                    us poor ant-like
                    infantrymen there to welcome the gift from the God of War. Sometimes I think in this way: In such an
                    advanced mechanized
                    warfare, why are these easily fatigued two legs still indispensable?</p>

                <p>The German troops surrendered as soon as they saw that the battle situation was not going well; they
                    would sometimes
                    raise white flags and sometimes shout for friends. But sometimes they also pretend to surrender and
                    call us their
                    friends. If you poke out your head, you will have at least one more guest in your head.</p>

                <p>Each of us soldiers likes to pick up some pistols, hand darts, uniforms, etc. as souvenirs, but
                    sometimes it is not
                    worth it. I still remember there was a "sand formation" last week, and because I picked up a box of
                    pearls one of my
                    hands was missing as a result. It turns out that the Germans had placed an 'ambush mine' on these
                    souvenirs. However, we
                    still like to pick up these freebies. After all, it is difficult to instantly correct the character
                    that has been
                    nurtured by this abnormal society. Fortunately, we are forgetful. Horrified and cruel things will
                    just slip away in a
                    moment through the always opened door at the back of our minds.</p>

                <p>If you ask any soldier if he would ever be willing to return to the front lines, the answer will be
                    the same: never.
                    American infantry is the most comfortable in the world, but the hardships involved are also very
                    unendurable. I
                    sometimes feel ashamed when I think of the soldiers who fought in the war in our motherland. If
                    everyone in the world
                    would have lived through the way we do now, I am absolutely convinced that there will be no more
                    wars in mankind. But
                    human beings are forgetful animals after all, and war is still a glorious event in the minds of many
                    people. In ancient
                    times, in the Middle Ages, and even in modern times, the toxicity of idolization is still deeply
                    ingrained in people's
                    minds. I sometimes curse everyone in the world, wishing that each of them would see a loved one
                    massacred.</p>

                <p>Now let’s briefly talk about the current general situation in France. The city that had been baptized
                    by artillery fire
                    was completely turned into a ruin of rubble. Perhaps Santa Clause will not come to this earth this
                    year because he
                    cannot find the chimney. There are very few cars on the road in France now, and we can see beautiful
                    girls traveling on
                    bicycles at any time. Speaking of women, some of them attach great importance to chastity just like
                    our Chinese women,
                    but many of them are really debauched, leading to their cases of sexually transmitted diseases being
                    three times more
                    than those in England. After this war is over, humans will still have to fight against these
                    spreading microbes.</p>

                <p>My hair has grown longer, and my beard has also grown half an inch. When I looked in the mirror, I
                    was almost
                    frightened. Why do I appear so ugly? I couldn't even recognize who it was. Fortunately, no lover
                    came to see me.</p>

                <p>You young people on the homefront, don’t be discouraged because you can’t join the army. Not only do
                    I not laugh at you,
                    but I also wish you good luck. If you see less and hear less about this war, then you will be happy.
                    Besides, there will
                    still be a lot of work for mankind in the future! This war will not end when the artillery fire
                    stops. Your work in the
                    future will be even greater than what I am doing now! It takes less than ten years to win a war, but
                    it takes centuries
                    to maintain peace. How to shorten this time is hence your responsibility. Each of you should take
                    the initiative to
                    shoulder this responsibility, so that our blood will not be shed in vain. Although we have been
                    sacrificed, we are all
                    willing to fight for a valuable cause. Although we are not the first in this era, we hope to be the
                    last. Since the
                    beginning of history, human beings have been constantly making sacrifices to progress into a new
                    era. After so many
                    human lives have been experimented on, thousands of thousands of lives have been sacrificed, and now
                    we have reached the
                    door of the peace objective of our ancestors. You, I beg you all, knock on this door and bring the
                    whole human race in!</p>


                <p>Our biggest wish right now is to leave the life of the army, especially for the infantry. But if you
                    are a monk for a
                    day and work for a day, if you are a soldier for a day, you must work for a day. Regardless of
                    whether I want it or not,
                    I already have a task on my shoulders. To this day, I still can't let go of my responsibilities, and
                    I still must
                    complete my mission. Suppose one day every soldier puts down his gun and goes home, there will be no
                    war. But we have
                    not yet reached this era. Humanism is useless at the moment because humanities themselves are
                    willing to be slaves. The
                    only approach now is to take this war to eliminate all wars, so first we still must end this war.
                    Therefore, we need to
                    hold the gun barrel tighter, while you all at the homefront need to buy more public bonds. Only in
                    this way could the
                    war end early and your lover could return. Perhaps you will not see your innocent and lively son
                    growing up to be sent
                    to the battlefield as cannon fodder. Think about it! Who would want such tragic histories to repeat
                    themselves? I know that from the end
                    of this month
                    onwared there will be the sixth war debt movement, so buy more government bonds! No matter what the
                    purpose is for it,
                    you can’t go wrong buying it. You should buy a few more hundred-dollar bonds for your happy life
                    now. You won't be losing anything
                    by buying bonds. On
                    the contrary, you will still gain huge profits. Afterall, what have you sacrificed? Come on, friend,
                    for your friend's
                    return ticket, let’s buy another hundred-dollar bond!</p>

                <p>My friend, when you write back to me, don't forget to tell me how many hundred-dollar bonds you have
                    bought.</p>

                <p style="text-align:right;">Your friend,</p>
