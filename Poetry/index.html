      <p style="text-align:center; color: rgb(73, 131, 73);">Selected Poems Published in 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s</p>
    </h1>
    <p>Although only a bit over a dozen poems were published and included on this page, in reality, throughout his life
      James
      Poy Wong had written the most poetry compared to other genres. There were three volumes of unpublished poetry
      remaining
      after his passing in 2020. As reflected in his “Foreword,” writing, especially in poetry was the very
      vehicle for the young Wong to express and relieve his depressive state of mind, life, and experience from his
      teenage
      years through his late 20s. The lack of poetic craft and the private sentiments expressed in these poems were the
      reasons Wong did not pursue publication of the works in the extant volumes. Wong’s ultra love for poetry is also
      evident in his study of poetry for his Master’s degree in English obtained in 1972. His
      great
      love for this genre is also reflected in his personal colection of hundreds of books on poetry - both in the
      Chinese traditions from the Tang and Song
      poetry to
      the contemporary exiled poet Bei Dao- as well as those from the Western traditions from W.B. Yeats to Erza Pound.
      After
      his passing, this collection was partially donated to the University of Alberta in 2022.</p>

    <p>Subjects and themes reflected in Wong’s poetry include thoughts of life, phenomenon, sentiments related to war
      times,
      immigrant blues, separation of families and friends, loneliness, social alienation, death and suicide.</p>
