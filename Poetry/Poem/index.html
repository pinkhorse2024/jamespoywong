				<p>母親，我本來沒有什麼可說的, 但是這年來的變幻，你一定也想知道。 無論怎樣，這些都是過去的事了, 我希望你明白這一點。</p>

				<p>It has been a year. It has been a full year since I received your letter last May. I am afraid I
					haven’t written to you for even longer time, perhaps a few years now. It wasn’t that I have
					forgotten you; in reality I didn’t have the courage to send out the letters. All the situations are
					especially dreary to me tonight. I often want to cry, and so I think of you again. My mother-- I
					reread all those letters I wrote but didn’t send out. You seem to have appeared in front of my eyes
					and I drop to my desk and cry. Your voice seems to continue calling on me by my ears. </p>

				<p>Mother, I really don’t have much to say, but you most likely would like to know what has happened and
					changed in these years. No matter what, all these are things of the past and I hope you would
					understand.</p>
