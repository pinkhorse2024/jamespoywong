						<h1>About this Project</h1>
						</p>

						<p>As the writer himself admitted to having forgotten what he wrote more than 70 years ago, as
							we
							have long immersed in an age of the gradual and eventual deaths of traditional writings
							occurring through their mutated forms of written, graphic, and digital expressions competing
							relevancy in a generation of vulnerability in and indifference towards crises of meaning, as
							we
							look to fear the possibility of final succumb of our humanistic agency to artificial forms
							of
							emotive and cognitive intelligence, this project of collecting and presenting James Wong’s
							writings is a small effort to preserve history through literary expressions that have never
							been
							acknowledged, formally documented, nor much read beyond an ethnic community enclosed by
							social
							discrimination . . . . . Just some random thoughts to be further expounded upon.....</p>
